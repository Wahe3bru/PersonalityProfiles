I/E,N/S,T/F,J/P,Essay
I,S,T,J,"My first 4 months at the EDSA have been filled with many new experiences; some of which were challenges, others were joyful, but all of them have resulted in positive growth for me as a person.

---Meeting new people---
I enjoy meeting new people and everyone I have met at EDSA has been pleasant. I have particularly enjoyed listening to the backgrounds of the strongest candidates within EDSA, as this provided insight into how they gained their experience in tools like python & SQL. I also cherish being able to build a network with the data scientists of tomorrow as well as established industry professionals.. 

---Working together in the lab---
Working in a computer lab as a formal work environment comes with its pros & cons. 
It's useful to have 99 colleagues, supervisors & facilitators who can provide a technical/personal support net if necessary.
An obvious con would be the noise distraction  - but at least I can say I know all the trending music albums of  2018, WIN!

---Working in teams & team dynamics---
I've worked on team projects and solo projects in a professional work environment. I enjoy both.
From my experience I would say a team works best when there's a team co-ordinator with a plan OR when the work is divided and conquered (provided everybody takes full responsibility for their part)

All the members of our first group were noobs to SQL & Python, and the gather and analyse phases really exposed our technical deficiencies and resulted in a lot of frustration when it came time to delivering on tasks. This experience took me out of my comfort zone and was an important lesson in patience for us all.

Our second group had a high level of experience, a strong team co-ordinator and team members who took full responsibility for their tasks. Even though the work was more complex it was a comfortable team dynamic.  

---How decisions in teams were made and are they consistent with how I make decisions---
Team decisions in both groups were made through deliberation. Decisions were easier to make if a person presented clear points on what their opinion was. Because our group dynamic was so strong decision making felt natural, very similiar to if I had to make the decision on my own.

---How rational or how emotional has the decision making process been---
If somebody had the technical knowledge then they could provide their interpretation of the best solution. 
If a problem required research then that would take place and we would then rely on rational and logical thinking to arrive at a solution. 
Regarding emotions, I used the open communication channels with facilitators and supervisors to discuss my emotions as opposed to letting emotions making project decisions. 

---Overall---
In my previous role as an electrical designer I was smitten by data analytics within the electricity metering sector. 
EDSA has provided the platform for me to pursue this passion on a broader scope of data using market leading tools  and most importantly to upgrade my own skill-set thus opening up new opportunities for me within the workplace."
I,N,F,J,"I joined the academy being at a crossroads of sorts in my life.  The academy offered me an opportunity to pivot my career out of engineering into data science after being unfairly dismissed and struggling to find employment as a result.

Meeting 100+ (faculty and students) new people who would now be part of my life for a whole year was something to get used to, even though I have worked for multinational companies. My ability to deal with people from different backgrounds, beliefs, etc. have been tested during the group work.  Needless to say that it can lead to tension in one's life if team mates are not pulling their weight.

Team dynamics are always a learning process/curve, thankfully it has not been a bad experience up till now. Needless to say, people try and cheat the system, act dishonestly and sometimes are just plain lazy. Many are too opinionated and are thus rendered incapable of making a great contribution.

My way of doing things is to always consider everyone's well-being, opinions and contributions.  Somehow some persons think its OK to be cynical and unhelpful.  At the end of the day, we are all supposed to be here to learn and become data scientists.  I can work on myself, to improve daily. That is what I will do."
E,N,F,J,"so far my experience has been positive and i can definitely see the value in the course. The experience of working with different people has been valuable to me. What has worked well has been the attitude that everyone in the team has to deliver and take responsibility. It has been difficult to step back and trust the team you work with, however in most cases team members have exceeded my expectations. I have felt a bit frustrated when team members have not applied themselves or have taken a substandard lazy approach to problems. I like to get stuck into something and get immediate results and improve from there. I think this approach has worked well however i have also learnt allot from team members who have a more structured and task based approach. Allot of time we spent on tangents that did not add value to the projects however some of the tangents either paid off in results or there was learnings we took from them. Our decision making approach has been to generate ideas and create a structured work flow around the ideas then distribute the work among individuals who take interested in the work flow. When we have conflicting ideas we typically took a democratic approach combined with some healthy debate. I find that i build relationships with the people I'm in teams with. This is when i get to know them the best. My strongest connections have been with my team members but also other people in the academy who i can learn from. I took the team on a bit of a data collecting tangent on the last sprint which was not necessarily the most productive use of time and could have been avoided if we understood the problem better. This was one case when i was probably too assertive on the team, however the way i like to make decisions is to get stuck into a workflow stream and adapt as you go and we didn't have supervisor direction at that point. I find the environment to be very stimulative and i enjoy going around to other teams and see what they are working on. I have a good relationship with some people and they are happy to share what they are working on which is great. I have also found the environment distracting at times, I would like to help people and I get satisfaction out of doing so, however I'm also not here to do that. Working with different people and mixing it up regularly is something Im excited about because everyone has such different learnings and experience and theres something to learn from everyone."
I,N,F,J,"I have been very fortunate to have the opportunity to join the academy this year. I have not been sure about my career choice, and as such the academy provided me with a great chance to change career paths. This will help me in choosing a new path and allow me to eventually reach my larger goals in life. Moving to Cape Town and joining the academy has not been too challenging, as I already knew two people in the academy before joining. This however made it a bit more difficult making new friends. I am typically more reserved, and do not easily make new friends, especially if I already have some good friends, in which case I do not see the reason to make new friends. 
Working in teams at the academy has been a great challenge for me. I normally prefer to work at my own pace and working in a team forced me to cooperate with other people and adjust to their skill levels. This sometimes meant taking on more of the work than has been allocated to me. In addition to this, if found it difficult working with individuals who were not as invested as I am in the projects and who were not aiming to learning as much from this experience as I intend to. 
Within our teams until now, leadership has been quite lacking. I typically do not like forcing myself onto other people, but in these circumstances, I was forced to take the lead in the projects. While taking the lead I tried my best to lead from behind, making sure that I had consensus within the team before deciding. Generally due to the lack of experience of one of my teams, this meant that I had to think of a plan, and the execution thereof, followed by the team implementing it without challenging the ideas laid out. This approach worked well, but I would have liked a greater input from the team, as it is unsustainable and if I left would render the team incapable of functioning properly. 
In my other team, people were much more competent and because we were only four members, decisions were much easier to take. We all had a good idea of what to do, but I was still elected as the leader, a role which were much more organic this time, and we had a much more balanced and consensual way of making decisions. However, the completion of tasks effectively was still not perfect when I left. While the teams struggled in making decisions, we never experienced conflict and we were generally not emotional when making decisions."
I,N,T,J,"Looking back to when one got to the academy and where I am right now, I can confidently say that I have grown not only intrapersonally but interpersonally and my optimistic perception of working with has also gradually shifted to the realistic end of the spectrum. I came with nothing but a positive outlook on the journey I had gotten an opportunity to embark on, however, I have learned a couple of valuable lessons - one of which stand out is the value of understanding your teammates before expecting any one of them to understand you. This has put by far put a cap on my assertive nature which has gotten me through a lot f pressure and given me an opportunity to even sharpen more of my softer skills which tends o help me quite a lot even outside the academy for I am a good vibe generator - one who only deflects negative energy with positive energies in whatever spheres I happen to find myself in. 

Getting to know my colleagues has been very exciting and I had initially thought I would do my best to get to know everyone due to knowing the underlying power of networking and how much you tend to ripe the rewards when you least expect it. However, due to various factors including time constraints, one hasn't yet gotten to know everyone. Nonetheless, all those that I've connected with have in a way pivoted me with the range of experiences they've been exposed to and if anything - I've found that if one connects with colleagues not only because of duties but to get a better understanding of who they really are and what drives them out of bed in the morning then there tends to be a relative ease of synergies when working with those people in a group. With this foundation only does good teamwork come into play which has proven to be crucial in implementing and fulfilling a common goal quicker.

Establishing people's unique abilities also hasn't been the easiest of tasks, this is one of the things that has by far made role or duty allocations a bit messy in groups. With this in mind when the team makes decisions which are usually made through a voting process duties tend to be easily misallocated which does not accord with how effectiveness is leverage (by exploiting each team member unique abilities to motivate everyone to play up their strengths and avoid their weaknesses with a proper balance).

Teamwork is not an easy job but it can be very exciting at the same time but it only takes one individual can have to break down a firm structure especially if that individual wants to make all the decisions- such hinders progress and flow of ideas in the team which in turn leads to a dull and average outcome.
  
I've found some of the decision-making techniques a bit irrational due to how central they tend to be especially when you find yourself in a group with nice people who will not express how they feel to whoever is doing so.  Over and above I have learned to only focus on making sure that what’s expected of me is delivered timely and not to miss the beauty of the process while focussing on relatively small hurdles when there’s a vast amount captivating material to engage  in.

I've also learned how to never bring my emotions to the workplace because people tend to step on sensitive things without noticing- for example having someone staring on your shoulder and commenting on the work you're doing is quite unpleasant and kills you moral but detaching from all of that and focusing on what's required has been the best of coping mechanisms."
I,S,F,P,"My overall experience at the academy so far has been great and somewhat challenging.

Firstly a team leader was elected for the team; the tasks were disturbed among the other members. There was no disagreement during team meetings. While we achieved our aim, all members were satisfied. The team achieved their aim but more could have been done if we had more time.

Allocation of work and workloads were decided by the team leader after discussing with the team. There were no arguments about the workload. The team leader assumed that everyone was on the same level. Some questions were answered but most were not answered to satisfy all members. Individual members needed to do extra research if their questions were to be answered properly. 

As a team we were able to work together, reliable and tried our level best to be punctual for our meetings. We allocated different tasks to each other and each person researched thoroughly and we co-ordinated our findings together as team and asked for support when needed. This personally helped me as an individual to be confident, however it was a bit of a strain to keep up with my mates as some have a vast experience in programming and statistics and sometimes I felt incompetent in the tasks given, but it helped me to gain knowledge and pushed me to learn harder.

The role played by the team members was that of a team player, several suggestions were made by everyone in the team and some of them were adopted. The team was selective in adopting new ideas.

The team worked well, agreements were reached on almost all issues but little new information was gained by all members. We believe that team work was an ideal method for quick information gathering, as learning by oneself is time consuming and tiresome. 

I believe I contributed effectively to the team by being reliable although I was a bit hesitant during the first stages because I had to adjust to different characters and communicate freely and not be afraid of being judged

I believe that group work is essential and would not mind working in the same team again as the aim of the team was achieved."
I,N,F,P,"When I got to the Academy, I felt like I didn't belong here. I felt out of place. I am a person who doesn't like to talk to people out of my own. So as people approached me, I got to know them. Getting to know my fellow classmates, made me realise that they are feeling similar emotions to what I'm feeling. I've met lots of like minded people. I personally like to work alone, working in a group has always been difficult for me. The Academy has made this easier for me. Forcing me to work on my teamwork skills. More often than not, there's been a group member who takes charge, keeping the team focused on the shared end goal."
I,N,T,J,"Attending the Explore Data Science Academy has already proven, and continues to be an amazing experience. It’s quite astonishing when you realize how much you’ve learned and mastered in the past couple of months, chief among which would be (and the subject of this essay), teamwork.

Meeting new people can be a daunting task for some (including myself). However at the academy it has been different from the start. The sheer excitement of all of the students and especially the Explore team (supervisors and facilitators) acted as a social catalyst, smoothing over any social awkwardness, and before we knew it we were getting along like a house on fire.

Working in teams with people from completely different backgrounds and personalities has been challenging throughout the first project, but with that being said, it has also been very interesting to see how each individual adapts to accommodate the team and to help build the team dynamic. Starting with the Cape Town Water Crisis project I honestly had no idea what to expect, and certainly didn’t expect team dynamic to play such a huge role in the success of the deliverables. The team had to overcome different levels of knowledge, skills, and self motivation. After a couple of late nights and flared tempers we managed to get the work done, and we only then realised that we overlooked the most crucial part of teamwork. Not only does one need self motivation, but also create an environment in the team to motivate each other and to be comfortable enough to ask for help when you’re feeling overwhelmed or struggling to get to grips with a difficult concept. Our team was definitely lacking that aspect, so we had to take it on the chin in regards to the deliverables, but walked away with learning this priceless lesson moving into the next sprint.

As we were assigned new teams for the RSA Stock Market sprint, it was refreshing to hear that we weren’t the only team that struggled with certain aspects of the team dynamics. 

From the get go we approached a more structured and interactive way of doing things. We decided to have stand up meetings every morning to report on the previous day’s goals as well as setting new goals for the day ahead. This already made a huge difference in the motivation of the team. Another part of our success was dividing the work so that we didn’t get overwhelmed as individuals but rather sharing the workload and having one-on-ones with the relevant team members to gain a deeper understanding on their section of the work.

This approach had even more advantages than we thought. Having more structure and communication between team members lead to lower stress levels(even though it was still ever present), resulting in cooler tempers and clear headed decisions that were less emotionally-driven than the first project.

Just goes to show that “soft” skills are just as important as technical skills when working in teams. Can’t wait to learn what I can from the brilliant and diverse people at the academy.

I,N,T,P,"what a wonderful place to be ,a place where in waking up in the morning is an easy task with the great desire of learning something new everyday. Meeting new people was the great thing to me because i had to learn how to work in a team and also socialize since i am not the person that do well in the crowd.

It was actually my first time working in the lab like this for some reason that my experience of labs was quite an instrumentals labs for testing experiments with no computers ,not that we didn't have computer labs but because it is my first time coding in the lab the reason why coming to EDSA was my first choice . The skills as a data scientist is the one that drove to apply and wanna learn coding. I have learned a lot by being in the lab and also working as a team.

One of the main problem i faced is working in a team or group rather,some groups are perfect that you might wish not to change again as for some its a disaster.Sometimes you set up time slots for the group to meet so as to discuss the progress of the deliverable and you will be very surprised when only one member pitch up or only you having thought that we have a lot of work to do,this is so disappointing and i would mostly prefer working alone in the future.

Working in a team is sometimes emotional draining but with decision to divide and conquer we could work together well. I am hoping to be in a great team of smart people that need not be told what to do since every sprint has on it ""to do lists"" ."
I,S,F,P,"The start of the academy was quite tricking due to meeting new people, unknown environment being away from home and family proved to be tricky.
First fundemnental sprint was extrememely challenging as memebers of the group failed to help and work on the assignment hence resulting in a lot of friction and stress. poor coomunication and bad attendance at critical times. resulting in wasted time having to send a message finding out the nessecary details from that perosn thus wasting time. 
Some of the problems of poor team dymanics was not dealt with as memebers did not realise the importanace of good team dynamic in order to complete the set out task. 
The next sprint was alot better as the group was organised and everyone commited to there assigned task which was intially lacking in the prior sprint. the group communicated effectiely in term of any problems incountered.
First sprint did reveal emotional weakness in the team as memebers where unable to keep up and instead of moving foward broke away and decided to give up instead of still trying to help the team with the current assign task. 
Second sprint was clear cut as the division of the two teams helped as those left were all that were driven and knew what was expected of them."
I,N,T,J,"In this Essay I will be discussing my personal experience in regards to being at the Academy and how its been like meeting all these new people especially for an introverted person as I am. I will speak about all the different teams I have been in, how different they were and how different I felt in them, what I have learned from all these different characters. I will be comparing the decision making that was done in teams versus my personal decision making.

Getting on a plane to Cape Town without a place to stay and no friends in the City was a big risk, the only certain plan I had was the Academy and with that I kept praying that it want a scam or a plot to get me to specific building then get kidnapped. I was fairly surprised to get here and meet people from all walks of life, who were also kind of questioning if this was legit or not, I mean its hard not to question it, it sounded way too good to be true and such good things we had learned don’t happen to people like us, but i guess it was our time to shine and receive blessings. That’s what I think of the Academy, its a blessing. With that being said, my experience at the Academy has had its ups and downs but what I like most about it is that it always ends with an up.I have learned A LOT, I have fallen in love with Data Science, I am doing things that my small mindedness used to consider was only for geek’s. I have learned to push myself, to always try and learn more, practice more because computers are always evolving.

Since I have met people with different personalities at the Academy, personality clashes has occurred which was 1 of my biggest lessons here, being able to work with different people who have different personalities. 

Working in teams wasn’t as easy as I thought it would be at first, everyone had their own idea of what they assumed was supposed to be done we all had different opinions which could not be dismissed because everyone's opinion is valuable when working in a team, but our opinions somehow seemed to clash. Working in teams has taught me to be patient, a quality I did not possess whatsoever. The second time we changed teams though it seemed as though everyone had gotten an idea of what working in teams shouldn’t be like, we were all basically just dipping our toes in this working in teams thing the first sprint, but the second sprint we were a bit more confident which meant we worked better with our second teams, improving as we go.

With both the teams that I have been with, we split the work equally amongst each other, making sure that everyone gets a chance to tackle the most important lessons like coding and the dashboard. We have a group Coordinator whom after we state our views, he/she would speak to our supervisor and a decision would be made in that way, the supervisor would guide us in the right direction after hearing what we thought was the right way.Its almost the same concept I use I guess when making decisions, I weigh all my options, see which one is best and which one has the worst outcome and I obviously go with the best outcome.

In conclusion the working in teams skill I am gaining is developing everyday,
I haven’t mastered it, heck its difficult to master it with so many personalities out there, but I am getting there."
I,?,T,?,"My experience at the academy this far has been stressful yet fun. I'm not one who enjoys working with groups, if it were up to me i'd be working on my own at all times. Starting the first sprint reminded me why I prefer working alone. We were not working as a group and certain people did not carry their weight, which was even more frustrating. However, I too am to blame as I did not speak up and let my concerns be heard. In the end some of us saw no other way but to tackle the task at hand and work towards finishing the assignments given. 

The last group I was in was the complete opposite. We only had three weeks to complete a sprint and therefore knew we had to work as a collective. Tasks were split and each one was accountable for a part in the project. We ended up working well together and got along outside of work as well. why it did not work with my previous group? I do not know why, but I look forward to working with different people with different dynamics."
I,N,T,P,"My experience at the Academy has been enjoyable so far. I am learning a lot of interesting and valuable skills and meeting many intelligent and interesting people. Meeting and working with new people has been a lot of fun and a rewarding experience. Working in the lab can be challenging. The open plan allows for many very diverse and unusual conversions to easily be started or joined but can also prevent work being done as people can interrupt or prevent others from entering or staying in a state of flow necessary for learning. This is especially destructive for slower learners like myself. Working in teams has also been challenging but very insightful. It is sometimes tricky setting up and understanding the team dynamics in new teams especially with people you don’t know very well, and so any practice in working in teams is always appreciated because team dynamics are not always easy for me to decipher or understand.  Decisions have been made as a group (at least that is my feeling) without one person in charge giving orders. This could also be in part because we are all still learning but I try to make effort so that each person in my group feels that their opinion is asked for and heard and so that decisions made are group decisions and everyone has the opportunity to raise differing opinions or votes of support. This is consistent with the way that I enjoy making decisions because I think it allows everyone to feel involved and dedicated to the outcome and everyone can have some feeling of what others in the group think or feel about the decisions being made. I cannot say if the decision making has been more rational or emotional as I do not know how to accurately determine that. Maybe it has been a mix of both, though slightly leaning towards rational."
E,S,F,P,"This journey has been exciting. The stress has been constructive in the sense that it has forced me to work. Everyday I am excited to come to the academy to interact with all the vast personalities this class has to offer. Given the nature of the work, some days are really tough and other days are really good (especially when my code is running). The academy has taught me more about myself, testing my limits and my understanding. 

My whole life I've always been a team player. Although I don't like being in charge, I somehow found myself in leadership positions based on my assertiveness and it became a norm. It was shocking finding myself in the opposite position during the first sprint. There was zero communication whatsoever, and this made me feel uncomfortable as I couldn't share my thoughts and my feelings, however we found a way to work well as a collective. 

It took me forever to wrap my head around the content of our work and for that reason it made me feel futile. Due to lack of communication, people did what they felt was the right thing to do, then we would later put everything together. In my opinion, I think there should have been a structure, or a leader who would keep us on track. The way decisions were made, we shared responsibilities based on people's strengths and weaknesses. We equally made decisions and that has led to our productivity, but sometimes there would be disagreements. At times, it would be emotionally draining, but from every low, there was growth. 

Throughout the roller coaster journey, there's been nothing but growth, understanding and learning. Understanding the workplace, understanding my colleagues and understanding myself."
I,N,F,P,"When we started at the academy the workload was easily manageable and most students were able to keep up with the learning curve, whereas those who struggled either asked their peers and caught up, or didn't and got stuck behind the pack. As the workload and difficulty increased, I was able to keep up as I have a better programming foundation than others in the course. Although this might have helped me a lot, it appeared to be a blessing and a curse. I found myself losing a lot of time which could have been spent on work, helping students (which is not a bad thing), but the questions that were asked were off topic from what I was currently working on and I found it difficult to get back in line with what I was doing.

When decision in teams need to be made, it seemed to be a myth. I had a team where I needed to carry a lot more of the workload than the rest of the team members in order to get the scores I wanted, trying to teach my team a thing or two a long the way. I had a similar situation the second sprint, not as severe, but where 2 members of the team got off to a flying start, the other 2 did more spectating than participating and one eventually found his feet and ended with a bang, where the last member, I felt, never contributed to the final ""prediction"", more than speculations. This is quite frustrating as I do like working in teams, however only when each members
 carries their own weight.

It might sound selfish, but I just don't want this affecting my results by much as it is my goal for this year to be 1 of the 30 students that will be going to BCX. I feel I am working hard enough and spending more than enough time working, but I am still not very happy with what we ultimately hand in or present as a group.

Finally I am very happy with the course content. The course has already taught me a lot more about data science than I thought I knew and can't wait for what is to come. This is an awesome experience and am happy I chose to do this."
I,S,T,P,"It is intimidating meeting so many new people all at once, especially with all the wildly different personalities and backgrounds. Sharing a work space is sometimes challenging when not everyone shares the same views on how a communal space should be treated in terms of cleanliness and keeping noise levels down. I have not interacted with a lot of people, only a small number of individuals who are like me in background and temperament. Team dynamics are by far the most challenging part of the course. I particularly struggle when team-members lack self-motivation and work ethic. I have found that often instead of insisting on a team member pulling their weight I would rather just do the task myself. I tend to feel that if someone lacks the motivation to do something on their own they are unlikely to perform the task to the best of their abilities. I also seem to have little confidence in others completing a task the way I would like it to be done. Generally, decision making in teams has been easy but this is mostly due to apathy or uncertainty surrounding the decision on behalf of most team members. I found this frustrating since this often lead to a very one-sided discussion and resulted in unspoken dissatisfaction with the resultant product. The decisions were also often ignored later, while I dont mind changing decisions I believe it should be communicated and that completing the project still be paramount. I feel that I often have a good sense of what is required to complete a project and that I can communicate these steps to team members, however I rarely have the self-assurance to properly delegate tasks and hold people accountable when they do not meet deadlines or complete the task at all."
E,N,F,J,"Coming to the academy has been the best thing that has ever happened to me and I am grateful for the opportunity.
when I learned that the academy is going to encourage teamwork I was excited to meet new people from different spheres of life and exchange ideas and network while at it.

working in teams for me was thus far ok. the most things I like about the team was the commitment to work and the work ethic thereof. when it comes to decision making I didn't enjoy the part as I felt a sense of dictatorship where a member would defy the group's decision and still want to impose what is best for a team and start delegating work to teammates based on their own vision. I felt that it defied the purpose of brainstorming and planning our objectives. 

the role that I played the most in the team was to always conscientize the group about the imperativeness of working within the scope and prioritizing on what is required of us and that should form a basis of we are going to structure our project and it would help with decision making.

In most supervisor meetings the reporting was based on ""I did that"", ""he did that"". for me that was a sign of individualism for a collective project it perpetrated unnecessary competition.

i enjoyed networking with a variety of people in the academy and having to also participate and win a hackathon hosted by the city of Capetown was one of the best networks and team collaborations that went well for me. 

i like having random conversations about technology and trying to link all of that to what we do here and there were few whom we'd connect on such inspire each other. 

A brief summary of how I work is i prefer to plan and try as much as possible to stick to the plan and always have a room for changes. consolidation is key and it helps in deciding between conflicting ideas."
I,N,T,J,"These past few months has been one of the most challenging but thrilling experience of my life. Coming here, I expected to engage more with people and I knew that being an introvert myself, this experience at the academy would force me to be more engaging with people. Something totally outside my comfort zone. But I was ready; not so much prepared, but I was ready to be challenged and I understood that growth is reached in the most uncomfortable spaces. This experience has taught me more than I could have imagined. I have learnt to be fearless and embrace the greatness that is within me. I come across as very shy, but the willingness to push myself into things that enabled me to speak up in a room full of people has made me realize that I do not get nervous about things I cannot do but in actual fact I get nervous about the things I am capable of but can also fail. In a way I am scared not of my inabilities but of my own potential. I understand that I still have a lot to learn as I am not fully comfortable with what I know now as I feel there is still a lot of knowledge to be gained. Coming from a bit of theoretical statistical background, it is interesting to see how all these techniques learnt in university can be applied in real world scenarios. Coming into this space, a space full of well equipped individuals, I felt a bit intimidated as I had no idea where my career was going and I lacked confidence about what I do and what I am really good at. This experience so far has definitely  given me a better understanding of my skill set and where my career can take me, but most importantly I have come to learn that I am not alone. And being able to meet lots of people who also are in a similar situation with me, has simply shown me that my worries are not worth worrying about and that things will fall into place. The environment here is quite relaxed, yet it has taught me how to behave and be professional in the workplace. The support from my peers has also been tremendous. Just observing everyday events with my supervisors has taught me more about teamwork, and how people can come together and get things done . Although sometimes I have to remind myself to use my inside voice, I feel I am adapting to the environment relatively well. Going forward, I expect to learn more and further develop my skills."
I,N,F,J,"My experiences at the Explore Data Science Academy

My experience of  meeting lots of new people has been a great one, it has only been a few months and I have already learned a lot from them, and I continue to do so on a daily level. In terms of meeting new people there is so much to gain, especially in terms of being offered  different perspectives, it has challenged my way of thinking. This has also taken me out of my comfort zone which in turn has taught me a lot more about myself and how to handle different personalities. 

My experience of  working together in the lab and in teams is much appreciated as it as close to as a real world experience, I've already been in a similar environment throughout University and have always found it enjoyable to interact with people. My level of productivity and performance has exponentially increased, mainly because of deadlines that I needed to meet and not wanting to disappoint my teammates, generally working with others helps with achieving more than as an individual. I can say that my interpersonal skills have increased, for example speaking and listening to others. I have come to realize that collaborating with others has helped identify my strengths and weaknesses, I am basically more self-aware. 

My experience of how decisions have been made in the teams I was/am in and how consistent that is with how I like to make decisions. A lot of the people here are considerate and we all want to attain the same goal, what I appreciated is, so far the people I have worked with take the time to listen to what a person has to say and try to take it into consideration where it is relevant and concise, there after decisions were made depending on how everyone felt.

 My experience of how rational or how emotional the decision-making process has been. Most of the decisions that were made were rational but as a group we took the time to take people’s emotions into consideration where possible. It’s obvious that we did not always agree completely on certain things, but when such occured, time was taken to explain to the other person why doing things in a certain way was more beneficial than the way the disagreeing member thought. Accepting the possibility of being incorrect has been an important role, especially when it comes to working with others.  

In conclusion, my experience was more positive than anything at the academy."
E,N,F,P,"My experience so far has been great though at first i was a bit anxious and excited about the whole program, working in teams was challenging at first still is but it is becoming less and less challenging, so far the groups i have been in so far are completely different and that's interesting in terms of knowing what works and what doesn't, also it helps on experiencing the different thinking processes..."
I,N,F,P,"My experiences at the EDSA
My experience s of the academy has been very intense, interesting and fun.
Even though I have only met a small subset of people at the academy, it has been great to have gotten to know them during this time. What is also particularly interesting, has been seeing how different everyone’s background and perspective is. Learning about where they come from and where they want to be in life and why they chose to be apart of the academy.
Working in the lab has been a great experience, and in reminds me of when I worked in an open plan office space and I feel like it’s a great comfortable environment to work in. it has also proven difficult at times, with slow computers and being in a noisy environment keeping focused can sometimes be tricky, but the views of the mountain are really great so I can’t complain too much.
 With regards to the team and dynamics, the two groups I have been a part of have been very different in terms of how we worked, however there was some overlap of the dynamics. One dynamic that I found between the two groups was that the more extroverted individuals for both groups took on a leadership role early on and the team took cues from them in each of the two groups and pushed for them to be in the leadership role. but for the most part the groups have had more introverted individuals than extroverted ones. So there hasn’t been any major conflicts or clashes for dominance.
For the first group there were differences in some of the personalities which caused some friction and conflict. Despite this, we all got a long and worked together cohesively to meet our goals. its natural that some personalities would create conflict but we never lost sight of why we were there.
With regards to the Decision making with the two groups. For the first group there was a lot of uncertainty in terms of what to do our how to approach problems which created an environment of aimlessness and uncertainty at times. With the second group we came to the consensus that based off of the strengths of the team members we would allocate roles accordingly. Decisions for the first group were made based on high emotions and what I think was caused by being in a new environment learning new skills and which created stress, this coupled with trying to meet the deliverables made tensions high. Whereas with the second group came to our decisions based on a more logical approach.
I would say that overall our decision making has been rational we tried to deal with our problem statements in a thoughtful planned manner which would allow us to cope and coordinate responsibilities effectively."
I,N,T,P,"Being at the data science academy has been an amazing path so far, Being into one room with people who are ambitious and love learning has got me all excited about the work we are doing and also having supervisors and facilitators who are determined and love their job motivates me even further and keeps me thrilled to be like them one day. 

I am very thankful to be part of the academy, because there is so much to learn everyday and it has proven to me that you do not need a specific field or a certain level of education to be a data scientist, the way the academy has been structured to have students in all fields with various level of education I think it was a great idea, because I would see someone who never studied computer science or statistics knowing a concept better than me who have those degrees, so in brief I can say all you need in order to survive at the academy is to be focused and know what is expected of you everyday.

I have been fortunate enough to be placed in teams of people who are determined and I have never struggled to get my group mate to deliver what is expected of them, hence I said most people at the academy are focused and know what they are there for. So I think the selection team did a very good job in placing us at the academy.

I appreciate also the fact that as much as the supervisors and facilitators are busy, they are always accessible when they help us and they do their work with passion, so I see myself getting better and better each day to become a data scientist and I am certain that by the end of the year I will be at the level at which corporate expects me to be.

The academy has coaching sessions that assists if I come across obstacles during the program, be it work related or personal problems, I have someone that I can talk to and share all the predicaments I am going through with, I find that very helpful because the workload can be too much and you might loose track of things, especially if you have something distracting going on in your personal life, which can deviate your attention from work,so I think the service is very useful and personally I have used it and had a load off my shoulders after I shared my problems with someone I trust will not judge or share my problems with anyone.

Being randomly placed in teams I believe will help us come across different personalities about people and learn to work around them, so although we will all not be with people we all had hoped to be with, but I believe that this prepares us to be fit enough to deal with people we will meet in the corporate world. And also learn to assist and be patient with people who might struggle with a certain concept or also learn from others."
I,S,T,J,"Attending the academy for the first time was like first year all over again, however the only difference is that not everyone is the same age. The idea of meeting people is really cool however the issue is when you will be forced to work with people which is where things tend to be a bit shaky because not everyone has the same standards. To make matters more interesting when your grades is directly dependent on your interaction with the team. During varsity I must admit I have not had the best experiences when working in a group because you tend to find similar roles and characters. However I am a bit optimistic given the diverse ages at the academy under the assumption that there are folk with work experience and hopefully more mature. Furthermore, I have come to realize that establishing solid authentic team dynamics's is also a lot more stressful than it actually may seem without trying to fake it for the sake of the team or trying to be too accommodating.  

The real issue is trust as decisions tends to be made around the dominant personalities perspective this may not particularly be in the best interest of the team as a whole. Although I do not always agree with the approach i would agree because fundamentally understanding and skill set is not equally distributed and also because at the end of the day it is about the delivery of the project. Overall I am happy that it is a very rational decision making process. Divide trust and conquer works best for the teams which is something I have come to learn. 

Within teams if you are lucky you may find someone who has the same work ethic and who is as dedicated in which case you would most likely help each other or you could find someone who understands how you work and complements your style. 

I think initially everyone has a problem with admitting that they don't get something until deliverables are due. The journey is very emotional especially towards the end and you tend to give less and less input as you become more concerned with the delivery."
I,N,T,P,"Good day, i really don't know to start with the essay besides good day. anyway now that's out the way lets start with business. 

I have had up and down moments at the academy but mostly up. Let me start from day one meeting the students from all over South Africa was great, meeting people with different personalities coming from different background. People of different races, culture and tribes (which i enjoy the most as i have been stuck in Cape Town since the day i was born.).

Getting into the first team, i was part of a crazy, fun team. The guys didn't look down on one another and they were open, that was there strength. the first few weeks everyone was working well but when getting close to the end it became frustrated as most team members started to lose focus (i assume that they got tired and that sprint was long). The following team was great when it came to work but the bonding wasn't there at all. two members liked working at home (they were very productive) the other two were quit most of the time.

When it came to decision making, it was a meter of bouncing ideas around and choosing which one to move with and stayed with that one for both teams. the second team was split into two teams and each of those two teams did their own thing that's why i believe the new way of doing things is great. submitting as an individual and as a team so that one has learnt the skill taught at that sprint.

thanks."
I,N,T,J,"I have had a very good and fun experience though it's often the case that I am under pressure. Being in the lab has allowed me enough time to practice and get used to coding, improved my efficiency in coding and working with the computer. Before coming to the academy I wasn't so used in the idea of working in a team, but along the year I have got better at it, knowing there is someone you can count on, rely on or go to when you need help. Also I have got to know some of them on a personal level which makes it easy to understand each other, their strength and weaknesses which allows us to form a strong team. But sometimes there are disagreements on what we think is right, but we have been effective in solving those, and lucky enough I have had very co-operative team members since the beginning of this year. Though I haven't got to know many of my colleagues but the ones I have got to know I would say it was a pleasure meeting them"
E,N,F,J,"My experience at the Explore Data Science Academy has been a great so far. My goals for Explore this year have been to develop & master the skills of doing Data Science as well as improve my leadership skills.

I have felt empowered the content that we’ve been taught. Four months in, I believe I have already learnt skills that would allow me to enter & succeed in the job market. The next 7 months I plan to spend refining my Data Science skills by using 1 hour of my evenings revising the content we learnt in class. 

With regards to my second goal (improve my leadership skills), I’ve had the fortune of being in a team that had a great coordinator & excellent team dynamics. I was also a not so great team coordinator for a team. I’ve taken many lessons from both of these experiences and read a book. That has given me practical lessons to improve my leadership skills.
I’ve been in two teams so far, what worked for the first was that 1. Our coordinator nudged us to always be making progress towards a bigger goal. 2. Teammates each voluntarily picked a segment of the project that they would be responsible for. 3. Loose deadlines were agreed to, these deadlines also had allowances for members to equip themselves with the skills required to fulfil their parts of the project. 4. The team met twice a week to discuss progress. 5. Over time each member grew to be very comfortable asking for help from others as well as being given feedback. This team dynamic encouraged each member to give their part of the project their all. Inevitably, some team members who are more technically advanced than others ended up taking on more advanced work than the rest, however this at no time felt like an overburden.

Given this very positive experience I was eager to also try being a coordinator when the next sprint came around. New teams were assigned & I volunteered to coordinate. These are the aspects I believe we could have done better. 1. We didn’t have a commonly accepted bigger goal. 2. I didn’t involve the team in identifying what our small goals were. I worked on a work plan overnight & presented it to the team. While the team loved the plan, individual responsibilities for the work was not assigned. 3. This led to a situation where members of the team were not clear on what their responsibilities were. 4. As a result of power leadership, only a few members of the team ended up doing the bulk of the work. We were able to pull together & present a satisfactory project, however I believe I could have led better & helped the team deliver a far better project. Each member of the team would have also been proud of having contributed fully in the project.

I have learnt a great deal from this experience & would like to give coordinating another try, like any other skill I believe leadership can be learnt with practice."
E,S,F,J,"Explore Data Science Academy, a road I never thought I would take in this lifetime. With a love and passion for cars, being accepted for a data science internship was one of the last thing I never saw coming. My love for travelling and exploring new avenues was on some ""let's do this"" tip. 

The first day coming to Explore Data Science Academy (EDSA) was beyond my expectations, because of the visually appealing facilities that were provided to us. At first I could not believe that this was me, in Cape Town, out of my comfort zone, pushing something that did not involve anything I studied. I came in with no expectations, however, I told myself that this is something that I need to give my all in order to leave with experience that will back me in the future. The speech our supervisors gave to us on the 22nd of January reassured me that I did not make a mistake by coming here. 

On the first week of being given work to do, which was to install the softwares we would be using throughout the year, I thought these would have been pre-installed before we arrived. At first, my introvert side had the steering wheel and I did not interact with a lot of people besides my housemate. I only started interacting with people when The Water Crisis sprint started. My team had people from different background such as; Bioinformatics Sciences, Computer Science, and Economic with a statistics in the mix, and were from different parts of South Africa (mostly Gauteng). One of the few things that stood out for me about them is that most of them were not the type of people that would start conversations and my loud side had to come out in order to make everybody feel comfortable. 

During the first week of the Gather sprint it took a while as a team to start making progress, but by Thursday we had already figured out a system that worked for everyone in order for use to have something to show to our supervisor. Once we put our weaknesses and strengths on the table, we started communicating better as a team. The results were shown when our supervisor told us that he did not think we would deliver what we delivered, however, after what we had delivered at the end of the fundamental, he had faith that we would be the best if not one of the best. 

My love for good music, adventure and socializing led me to connecting with more people than just my group. Most of my time during the fundamentals was spent helping people, building friendships that would carry me through the EDSA year or even greater than that, learning languages like Python and SQL, and channeling my mind to data scientist mode. On weekends my colleagues and I would tour Cape Town by going to the beach, hike up the mountains we could see from the EDSA lab, visiting malls and theme parks around Cape Town.

Python, one of the most complex languages to learn. Well, that is what I thought since i had no programming background. Two of my teammates had experience with working with other languages so for them, changing from one language to another, it was fairly doable. This was to my advantage since I had two people who I could consult with whenever I ran into a problem in Python. 

The presentation fundamental was one of the most laid back fundamentals we had to face since we had preplanned what we wanted to add in our slides and had a clear storyline. The fact that we had to split up after the fundamentals tore us apart, however, we vowed not to exit the Whatsapp group we created. During the review week, that weekend, a few of the people I have never talked to and a few other that I was friends with in the EDSA lab suggested we go out to a theme park near Canal Walk Mall to take our minds of the water crisis sprint. The character that were part of this outting were very shy, yet had very interesting backgrounds. I am still friends with most of them. 

The Stock Market sprint came and flew by. I was not really feeling my team since it had a lot of judgemental people who felt like they knew better. We lacked communication, but we managed to pull through and find the sprint in one piece.

The events that BCX hosted were on of the highlights of my first few months at EDSA, because of the amount of inpirational people I engaged with at those events. I felt like this was where I am meant to be every time they spoke about how lucky we are to be here and that what is waiting for us is greater than our wildest dreams. The week off takes the cup. I never expected to go home until at least July. 

I am honestly grateful to be spending the year at the EDSA lab, could not have chose anything else."
I,N,T,J,"The academy is amazing, I love this petry dish of talent! With a handful of genius characters here.. all with our own backgrounds and unique stories, the Explore Data Science Academy is the best place to develop our data analysis skills. I love my time at!

So far, I've experienced a whole lot of pressure to change into something better. The more I spend time studying, the better I feel, more comfortable I become and the closer I get to being a quality employee or entrepreneur. Everyday I come to the office, which I feel at home in, I learn something new.. something I can directly use in a business application. I look around this entire building and get inspired to start my own business with what I've learned here. We speak among ourselves about business and how the Academy is helping us realize our ideas clearly. Without the information to back our ideas up, it's difficult starting.

The availability of information is outstanding. I really appreciate this nest. My last two teams were great to work with. We achieved a bunch, again, thanks to the resources available. The first sprint was tough though. As a team, we realized our strengths and taught each other. I didn't have a problem with SQL or Python because I used both technologies before. Understanding the statistics applications for the data we were given was difficult. Worst off, the water crisis data wasn't collected well. This wasn't the worst experience because the data taught me that not all things in this career are perfect. What I can perfect are my skills in data cleaning.

What I realize is that there are a limited number of solutions to data analysis. If I perfect all outcomes to data science, I could have a breeze at work in the future. I believe in being hyper prepared for all things.. game theory on Data science would prove beneficial. 

Emotionally, I'm great. This academy brings out our best and worst skills and it provides a controlled environment to mend holes in our analytical judgement. This is a relief to me, emotionally and physically because It becomes a process of bettering myself on a daily, bit by bit without forcing myself under stress."
I,N,F,J,"My experience at EDSA so far has been a combination of challenging, fascinating, and unpredictable. Coming into this academy, I was excited that I would get to meet new people and learn new skills; I anticipated that it might be somewhat difficult engaging with new people (since I was introverted) and coming to grips with new technical ideas (because I was more a creative than a technophile), but since I loved a good challenge, I was still excited to immerse myself into the experience.

To my surprise, the challenges I faced were none of what I anticipated in that I have generally been able to interact cordially with new people and to understand the technicalities of this program. The greatest challenge by far has been working in the lab. Being in an environment with so many people (all with different personalities, habits, learning techniques and preferences) has forced me out of my natural inclination to isolate myself when working. Because I am very easily distracted, I have had to think carefully about how to navigate the space and how to simulate an environment that is conducive to my learning. 

I also found that being in a team and having to consider how to optimally ration the work, was challenging, especially in the beginning because we didn't yet have a good understanding of each other's strengths or weaknesses. That said, once we had gotten to know each other fairly well, we were able to make decisions that we believed would amplify our strengths and diminish our weaknesses so that we could produce results of the best possible quality. In that sense, much of the decision-making in the teams has been rational rather than emotional. We would apply logic and reason to what we wanted to achieve and how we thought we might be able to do it, but I found that there was always room to be empathetic and thoughtful (thereby engaging our emotions rather than reason) if, for the sake of a team member, we had to alter the original plan.

This is somewhat consistent with how I personally make decisions: I think that most times I base my decisions on what I think will yield the best results in terms of what I am trying to achieve, even if this happens to be inconvenient or taxing in the process; other times, especially if the decision to be made is not of great consequence, I make decisions based on my emotions if I believe that the 'rational' or 'logical' decision will likely hurt someone's feelings or cast me in a bad light.

All in all, I have learned an awful lot about myself: from my preferences, to my strengths and weaknesses, to my character... I have found the learning curve steep and my emotions rather turbulent throughout this process, but I have enjoyed every part of the challenge and what it could mean for my future -- it is this prospect that holds me together on the worst days and exhilarates me on the best days."
E,N,T,P,"Imagine being so excited to finally meet people that are like minded. Maybe it could be rephrased as meeting people like me. However, instead, we meet a small sample of different types of people all with different types of personalities. Yet again you find yourself stuck in a world with different types of people that are different, with different interest and ambitions, that translates to how they make decisions every day. Their decisions affect you, especially because we are working in teams. On the other hand, the decisions I make affect them and how the team processes. According to the personality test, my personality is defined by five letters ENTP-T, according to this classification I am a debater. As a true debater, I am not convinced, but I will play along for the suck of this test and discuss how my personality has affected my general experience at the academy.

The lab has allowed us to have access to each other as well collaborate, although working effectively in the lab can be a challenge, because they are many distractions. I have found it easier to get to know people and the type of strengths, knowledge background and passions they have in general. This type of knowledge allows me to be more efficient in knowing who to ask for help from for different things.  Which I do prefer doing more than asking a facilitator. I have always done that in the past where I prefer working through a challenge with a peer, along the process I learn more than I would have otherwise. 
Now when its comes to working in teams, I have always, been the first one to speak and give an opinion because I came in with a variety of ideas, it’s the extroverted side to me. Therefore, I end up leading, the team. In this role I prefer not to police people, therefore I have either allowed people to lead themselves then I would make sure that the project requirements are completed at the end. With the last sprint I dedicate the responsibilities according to people’s backgrounds strengths and interests. With one person leading a deliverable for the project then at end I would ensure that requirements for the submission are met. 

I have employed similar strategies in the past, working tangibly with what people bring to the table. This has framed the decision making in the teams I have worked in. If someone shows up we will work with them if not we work with what we have. This approach has made it easier to focus on the objective and deliver the projects.    The decision making has been rational most of the time but a little emotive at times, with irrational judgements being employed to make assumption on people attitudes toward project work. Which creates a barrier for people who have not been pulling their weight in the past to immediately, integrate into the teams later.  However the team dynamics have forced me to be a finisher."
I,N,F,J,"My experience at EDSA has been an interesting one for me thus far. It has pushed me to get out of my shell and to interact more with people. Since I have been at the academy I have realised that I am smarter than I think and I have a lot of valuable knowledge and insight to share.

My biggest fear before coming to the academy was the social aspect and having to interact with different people, but since I have been here I have been able to overcome this fear. When we were first placed into groups I was literally sweating, heart rate was high and felt sick to my stomach at the idea of being in a group with strangers. The second time we were split in new groups I wasn’t as nervous. I have become more social and enjoy meeting and working with new people now.

Working in groups has been a challenge for me. It can be very frustrating because everyone is different and everyone has a different approach to the learning process and project management. I’ve learned a lot about myself through working with others. I took the backseat in some things even when I knew a better way of doing things. I spoke out and I saw that this helped the team steer the team in a better direction. I have become more assertive. I thought I was a very passive person and that I couldn’t be assertive to save my life, but now I think I am more assertive and I don’t find it as daunting. 
My biggest frustration with working in teams is dealing with people who think they know everything and aren’t willing to open up themselves to learning something new from their fellow teammates. We had a person like this in my previous group. The person would dictate to the team and didn’t want to collaborate with the team, they had a dominating personality and the rest of us were very shy. I realised that if none of us didn’t speak out we’d fail the sprint and I then forced myself to breakout of my shyness. I think I am still fairly shy but when it comes to work I fight through my shyness. 
Decisions in my previous group were initially made by one person. I prefer for problems to be discussed by everyone in the team and different possible solutions explored and to come up with a collaborative solution. I have found this in my current team. But there are still issues, such as people letting pride and emotions get in the way work, and people who are distracted and aren’t as committed to the project. 
Working in the labs is a challenge. There are a lot of distractions and noise and I cannot focus easily, I prefer to work at home, I get so much more done at home. Some people come to the academy to socialise more than anything and this very distracting for me."
I,N,T,J,"The past 5 months at Explore Academy have been challenging. I have had to make great adjustments in order to be here. There have been both positive and negative experiences. One of the most positive experiences has been how much I have learned. I have met a lot of people that are highly intelligent and who have the same interests. I have worked with 2 different teams. I prefer to work alone but working in a team makes more sense due to the sheer volume of work. The first team experience was incredibly frustrating. My team members were highly introverted and not technically strong which made discussions and assigning tasks difficult. Even when tasks were assigned there was no accountability to meet deadlines. I prefer to chip away steadily at work as opposed to rushing close to the deadline to finish. Working with my second team was much better. We met regularly, and communicated a lot. Tasks were assigned and everyone was accountable. The team members were very helpful towards each other."
I,N,T,J,"My experiences at The Academy so far have been life-changing to say the least. Meeting smart, passionate, hardworking and ambitious people from all different backgrounds who happen to have so many similar interests as mine has been an interesting journey. 

Being an introvert who prefers working alone and at my own pace within my own space , I had to quickly find a way to adapt and polish up on my social skills in order to socialize with 99 strangers who I am going to be learning data science with. I understood from the word go that the need to socialize and form meaningful relationships with my fellow interns could see me forming a strong network that may be helpful many years to come in my career, long after the internship. The Academy’s emphasis about the importance of team work is a concept that took a while for me to warm up to. These teams have been exposing me to different individuals from varying academic, social, work and geographical background with different personalities: introverts, extroverts, intuitive, artistic and even some really funny characters. Most of my teammates have been phenomenal and experienced in fields that I had no previous exposure to. I have learned a lot from them. Equally I’ve also encountered some independent and disagreeeable teammates who required me to adjust my levels of patience, tolerance and understanding of those that may not necessarily share similar beliefs with me. There has been a need to be patient and tolerant to other people’s points of view and approaches to solving and completing team tasks. In our teams, due to differing views, opinions and approaches we have had to use democracy (voting) in order to reach most decisions within the groups. Although it is easy for one to resort to taking emotionally-driven decisions due to one’s firm beliefs in their own ways of doing things a high level of emotional intelligence is critical for favourable team dynamics. The Academy is based in Cape Town, a city which I’ve only visited on holidays before. Moving to Cape Town had its own challenges which required me to have a solid ‘family’ away from my family and fortunately I have found my fellow interns very resourceful in many ways even outside of the ‘labs’. For example we have a group in which we share information on accomodation, transport around the city, social events and other extramural activities. I have had the chance to test my team-building skills and virtues through the regular group sessions we have with Nuri and I believe they have been very helpful in giving me an idea of how I relate with other people in less formal settings. Credit is due to our supervisors, facilitators and oprerations officer; they have been helpful in making our internship experience a manageable and definitely one that will be memorable years to come. Their commitment to the programme makes it easier for people of all personalities to settle in nicely within this diverse small community."
I,N,T,P,"My Experience At The Academy So Far

It has been an interesting 4 months and although I was apprehensive about meeting and having to work with new people, I still enjoyed the work and I am looking forward to what comes next. The group work and team dynamics have been a particular challenge and although I haven’t really socialised with my colleagues since I arrived in Cape Town, there have been some friendships formed mostly with the students who live in the same house as me.

The team dynamics were a challenge during the fundamentals sprint because we didn’t have a fair division of responsibility as well as accountability in the team. Some group members would slack off and not do their part and it was hard to hold anyone accountable because we were all concerned about being nice.

The decision-making in my group in the fundamentals sprint was a mixture of the rational and emotional, we did some things right but other things badly because no one wanted to take responsibility, there was too much passing of the buck. The team was also beset by laziness and an unwillingness to really get down and learn what was needed to deliver the project.

For the RSA stock market sprint, my group was somewhat better in that most people were hard-workers and we divided responsibilities early on based on the perceived strengths of each individual. The only really serious problem in my group was the communication between the different areas of functional responsibility, it was clear that the group members who prepared the presentation did not fully understand the analysis that the analysis team had performed.

The decision-making in our group was rational.

As for working in the labs, it is a nerve-wracking experience for me because a significant proportion of people simply go there to socialise and it is distracting for some of us, I prefer working in an environment of absolute silence(hence I prefer working after midnight) where I can simply think about the problem and allow myself to be as creative as possible in solving the problem.

People who do not assist my thought-processes in terms of thinking about the problem and its solutions are an irritating distraction. I cannot be around too many people for too long because I eventually lose my focus on the problem and have to focus on the people, it would be so much better if silence was mandated and enforced in the labs. We also need more individual work instead of group-work.
 
This all suggests ways I could do more to contribute to the group and some signs that I have learnt some of the lessons that emerged from my previous group, there is still a lot of trepidation about what comes next. I hope I meet group members who are committed to the project, otherwise, everything will end in tears."
E,S,F,J,"My experience at the Academy has been exceptional. Meeting new people have been amazing, specifically working with them. It is very much challenging from first inception to relate, but with time things gets better when we begin to know and get use to one another. There are some odds events were one or two group member does not want to participate(eg. missing meetings) or does thing on their way as oppose to what agreed in a group, of which is really a problem to me if they are not participating and also productive, especially when they do not meet group expectations or do not do group works at all, of which other members end up doing their work. This means that as a group we take a collaborative decision and planning and we expect everyone to deliver as agreed and planned. Being in the lab is one of the best way to work, especially when it comes to group work, i have find it very collaborative  and useful. It's unfortunate that some of the group members choose to work home and or just leave early and or come late. I have found this behavior hinder progress, especially if tasks have been divided into sub groups among group members. The most critical aspect of group is always communication. Most members usually communicate their inability to complete task late or when work is due. Some of the members get emotional when we are against their approach, of which at the end of the day we always encourage one another to see the right side of the approach to task or project at hand. Working with many different people have taught me to rely on others, that means to trust that the other member can do the work, even better than me. And it has been fun leaning since day one."
E,N,F,P,"I enjoy meeting new people from different walks of life and having constant, everyday social interaction. I have been slightly reserved when it comes to approaching people as most are much older than me. I also have a fear of being inadequate or unqualified as many people have already worked in professional environments and have a qualification, undergraduate and otherwise. The large emphasis on group work is a big learning curve for me as I have always preferred to work alone and do everything the way I want, although I have improved that since my time here. I tend to not take charge unless no one else does and am better at talking to people and helping them them find their role. I am versatile and don't mind taking the least desired role despite having preferences. No one in my group is very decisive. We have a general guideline that we try to stick to although that hardly is the case. We prefer to be versatile in our approach to work. That is rather consistent with my method of making decisions. I am a little less organised than my group is though. I tend to procrastinate and have to make major decisions or complete important tasks very last minute. I tend to sway very easily depending on my emotions. I do know when to not let my emotions run ahead of me (since it is something I am known to do) and put my foot down, take a step back and examine things from a rational perspective. It is hard for me to do this as it is not easy to put my emotions beside me."
I,N,T,P,"I honesty been enjoying my time here and i have no regret on the choices i have made. It has been really educational and i love the structure, the environment and that no one will force you to work you just have to push yourself as much as you can and that the facilitator are really helpful and you can bounce ideas with them and see how far your able to explore your imagination.

As for meeting new people it's always nice to here stories about other people and how far they had to go to be where they are in life, combine that with different cultural group and other things i got to learn more about people's culture and stories each can tell. To work together it's really tricky fun at times but tricky, it does not matter how many times you have to do it i think it will always be tricky if i where to talk about it i wont have enough words left.
As for making decisions it's simple to have everyone agreeing to goals but when the deadline has arrived people have stories, and i'm unable to relate to their excuses, honestly i wish everyone could adhere to their words, it not really how i would like decisions to be made i like to explore a lot when i'm working on something but due to time constrain sometimes it's just best to do the expected and if there is enough time explore some more. Some team members are a too sensitive way too sensitive but i will leave that part there.
I love this academy i wish there was more time to be here to learn a bit more, there are enough resources here to even conduct maybe research, for instance we all know how to write good machine learning algorithms but we don't understand how they work we might even not be able to improve them."
E,S,F,P,"My life at the academy.

It has been a wonderful experience, so joyous and full of many possibilities. it was the 22nd of January 2018 when I took the the tax from Kraainfontein heading to Woodstock, a place I have never been, I was told it is not far from Capetown CBD. the exact location I was going to was the Woodstock exchange building that's where the explore data science academy is located. with help of asking people in the taxi and help from GPS I was able to find this building and I got there around about 10:30 am, yes I was very late I got to the presentation room where Aidan (the Supervisor) was giving overview of the academy and what was expected from us(the student). The room was full of 100 students from different provinces, races and backgrounds. I listened to this long bearded white guy speaking and he was so eloquent and profound in his own right. one thing that struck my intention was the emphasis in his speech about how intelligent we are (the students) because apparently about 8000 people applied for the program, only about 3000 people were able to finish the whole selection process and 250 people were interviewed and we were the top 100 that made it to the program.
Aidan's words were full of passion and compassionate, so inspiring and encourages, they gave birth a new hope in my life I knew then and there that I was not what I have been labelled by some people a 'failure' there was more to me and I knew that this opportunity was the beginning of the great journey ahead. I promised myself that I will do things different this time, I will work hard and play less, I would make few friends and I will pray more and give thanks to the heavenly father.

it was about a week later where we(students) were split into a group of five people to work on the Capetown water crisis using the skill we have learnt over the past week i.e SQL, Python and Power BI. our group name was the bean bags, a group of four males and one female, we embark on this project,  we use the divide and conquer approach to help assign work to each member, my group members were wonderful people to work with, we jelled and had so much fun together . the bean bags often worked together, using one computer and we helped each other with tasks assigned to each member. we worked together for two months and we had to present our findings regarding the Capetown water crisis solutions or suggestions when the sprint came to an end. 

we were split once again for the South African stock market project, now I was working with different people I had to adjust to the new team which went by the name of StockOverFlow, I was a bit nervous because in my previous team I already made friends we were not only working together but had forged friendship amongst ourselves but I had to adjust.  StockOverFlow was a team of three males and two females, the sprint was only for a month and there was so much to be done. learning different models to predict the stock prices was very fascinating and challenging for me.  we used the divide and conquer approach assigning tasks to each member and consolidating what each member has done to google drive, it was the 26th of April when we presented our model and predictions of the stock price and we had a one week break and came back for another sprint. I realized that in a very short space of time I have learned so many many skills and I can apply them to solve real world problems. being here has been a wonderful experience and I am grateful."
I,S,T,P,My time at the academy has been very positive. I've had no unpleasant interactions with any person so far but I don't believe I've cultivated many deep relationships aside from perhaps one. The two groups I've been assigned have been socially pleasant. My first group wasn't ideally organised but my second group was better in that regard. There wasn't a particularly assertive presence in my first group unlike my second but there was a positive dynamic present in both. I prefer not to make decisions for the group but I try my best to pull my weight if not more to not be a burden.
I,N,T,P,"Starting the academy has been a wonderful experience. The Cape town is a beautiful city and the location of the academy could not have been better. Meeting all the different characters has really been an experience.In the first few weeks meeting new people on a daily basis was sometimes intimidating. Teamwork has never really been my strongest skill and it has always been something I would like to improve upon, and when I heard that the academy has a strong teamwork emphasis I was happy.The academy and working in the lab has a strong social element to it, even though the work we are learning is somewhat technical. In the first sprint, I quickly discovered how diverse our group was. We had vastly differing amounts of experience from fresh high-school graduate to someone that had been working for a decade. We also had differing skill sets. Working in these groups has been challenging and rewarding at the same time. For the Cape Town sprint our primary downfall was a lack of planning as who does what. This resulted in us being almost late for a few deadlines. Communication within the group could have been a lot better. I tend to keep a flexible approach with completing tasks, this flexibility ended up costing because we did not establish proper deadlines."
I,S,T,J,"From a social perspective, my experiences at the Academy have had a refreshing impact on my personal development. I prefer to do things by myself.   This is reflected by my interest in gaming, reading and fan-fiction writing. However, I am willing to interact with others when necessary.  I enjoy paintball with friends far more than sitting in a lounge rather making casual small talk. This applies to the workplace as well as we are essentially doing things together. Even when talking, we inevitably get into topics related to coding and such. Generally people (outside of the academy who have known me for years) seem to identify me as an introvert but this can give the misconception of poor communication skills which isn't always the case. I have not had too many issues communicating with team mates and others in the class regarding various topics ranging from work-related to hobbies (especially sport, gaming and anime). I prefer to finish that roleplaying video game than do some lounge talk but I also like talking about science and nerdy things. In other words, when I need to socialise, I have no problems doing so. 

Intuition and observation are both valuable traits in the workplace such as a data scientist team-based project. Working in teams has allowed me to utilise both. I have found that often I do analysis and others who haven't done it can apply their intuition. I have managed to do the same thing. This is different from academics before where I would essentially do everything by myself. In this regard, the team-based nature of the course has done very well. Often we think we are good at one or the other but working with others can stimulate us such that we can potentially become good at the trait we previously thought we weren't naturally suited to. When this is not the case, working in teams can sort of force us to find ways to overcome this weakness or to make it a strength instead. 

That been said, the team dynamics sometimes involved a lack of coordinated planning among the team members. While it is good to keep things open, that should be applied to a plan rather than to no plan. If you decide on a certain approach to solving a problem that involves coding, dashboard and so on, that doesn't mean that you can't improvise. I do not agree that improvisation is the ultimate way to do things. We make a plan and rely on open-minded thinking such that if the plan doesn't appear to be working, then we improvise.   

Generally in my experience at the academy, emotion seems to rule the roost with logic been seen as a potential barrier to team work cooperation. This can mean that students end becoming to dependent which can affect teamwork negatively in the long term. 

Overall the course has excelled in bringing out personality traits of relevance to the workplace, providing opportunities to overcome weaknesses or utilise them as strengths instead."
I,N,T,J,"The academy has been a very challenging experience. I expected the prior coding knowledge I had to be of help but it had been of very minimal help, the greatest challenge for me is Statistics. I am slowing getting to the point where I don't actually try to understand the concept thoroughly  but rather get the basic theory down so I can focus on the application.

Overall, it has been a very insightful journey, learning how to interact with different personalities and group dynamics. I am really excited to leaning more about NLP and Regression and how to incorporate that in app development and monetize it.

I genuinely do not regret applying to the academy and although there are days of doubt and hurdles remembering the greatness of this opportunity is always a great motivator."
I,N,F,J,"A big part of joining the Academy this year was meeting and working with lots of new people. This has been an unexpectedly positive experience. Despite everyone being from different backgrounds, there is a sense of camaraderie and the other interns have been very friendly. Even though everyone is being tested and graded the environment is non-competitive with most people being willing to help each other. This has made it enjoyable to work in the lab. However, the noise and bustle of the lab can sometimes be overwhelming and draining so I find it productive to sometimes spend an hour or two after a day in the lab working at home where it is quiet.

The most challenging aspect of the year so far has been the teamwork.
During the first project (Cape Town Water Crisis) there were at times conflict in the team due to some of the team member not contributing as much and therefore shifting the workload to other team members. While this has led to some resentment by team members, it was expected. In team projects the work is rarely equally divided and this team managed to complete the project despite the difficulties. After reflecting on the experience I was grateful to have done a big share of the work as it gave me an opportunity to learn a lot more than I would have otherwise.

The second project (the JSE stock market sprint) had a much shorter time span and therefore how the team approached the project had to be different. The team had to divide up the work as there was no time for everyone to be involved in all the deliverables. This was hard for me to do as it meant trusting other people with work without directly being involved in it and being dependant on them to complete it.

The process of decision making in both teams have been very democratic. The team discusses the problems and possible approaches and there is usually an obvious decision that everyone agrees on. The decision making has so far tended to be rational with team members not being very emotional. The most emotional part of the projects were the stress that we faced as the final deadlines neared.

All in all, the experience at the academy so far has been very positive and I have learnt a lot. I hope to improve the way I approach team work in the upcoming sprints."
E,N,T,P,"It has been over four months since I decided to embark on this journey. Packed a bag, moved to a new city and took the first step to living the best moments of my life. 
I love meeting new souls. It is always fascinating finding out where someone else’s journey began, how similar or different the footsteps they have left are. Being amongst 99 brilliant minds is incredible, getting to know them is refreshing. There are people who stand out, but everyone is unique.

I have always been good at working on my own, taking the reins. The ability to work effectively in a team is an acquired skill, having to understand different personalities, how people deal with problems and how they all communicate.

Delegating has seemed to help in terms of getting work done in the teams, with each person taking a piece , we were sure to finish our elephants. 

The decision-making process was  structured, which benefited the whole team. The guidelines from the rubric and from our supervisors helped to keep us on the right track. My decision-making is mostly based on impulse, so following a process was ideal for getting results.

It was great having team members who pay attention to detail since I mostly focus on the bigger picture. They made sure that our work was appealing.

It has been quite an experience, with constant learning. I am growing my skill set, including soft skills. This is just the beginning, I have a lot more to learn."
E,S,T,J,"It‘s the greatest opportunity to be part of the 100 chosen individuals for this wonderful programme. The Explore Data Science Academy (EDSA) environment makes me feel welcome and it is perfect in terms of collaboration and networking with different individuals that have interesting views and personalities. For me it’s hard to distinguish between the EDSA and work environment. This is the type of environment that prepare you for real job.

 EDSA provides one with the opportunity to learn and to work with diverse group of people in terms of career background, culture and religion. Working in groups with different individuals for each project has been exciting. Throughout this time, I’ve learned a lot about working in teams. First of all I’ve learned that through team work we achieve more in terms of results and learning new things. Secondly, when we come to decision making, everyone has their own opinion but coming to a final decision is another thing. So I learned that it’s not about voicing out your opinion, but convincing fellow team members that indeed your opinion will be fruitful.

When it comes to team strategies to embark on a particular project, it’s not a one size fits all situations. Each team has to come up with its own strategy as to how they are going to solve the assigned problem. This is difficult, especially when you have to serve as a team coordinator and you have to serve again, this time in a complete different team with a whole set of different personalities and characters. In this instance I learned that strategy is based on the skills, capabilities and mostly the team’s attitude towards the project at hand. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of your team members is a good start.

So far a have learned a lot. I’m still intrigued and eager to learn a lot more. I feel like I am becoming a real data scientist with each day that passes and this is all thanks to EDSA for giving me this wonderful opportunity."
I,S,F,P,"Choosing to spend this year at the Explore Data Science Academy could easily have been the best choice I have ever made. The choice has renewed my feeling of purpose and educational/occupational direction. I have learnt more in the past 3 months than I thought I would have for the entire year and am grateful for having been presented with the opportunity.
The fellow students and EDSA staff have added to the excellent experience I have encountered thus far. Interacting with such brilliant minds results in one, inevitably, attempting to better themselves and I have experienced this first hand. I am excited about the path that EDSA is setting me on and look forward to what the future holds for me as a prospective data scientist :)"
E,N,T,J,"We have been at the Explore Data Science Academy for 19 weeks (I counted); let’s simplify to 3 months shall we? 

It has been so exciting working in a group on challenging problems, I feel like a world of possibilities has opened up for me and for us. 

It has been exciting and overwhelming to have met so many new people. Right away I seem to have made a name for myself. I am proud of this, but even more excited that some people feel that I am someone they can come to for help - both practical and emotional. Helping others is a role I am comfortable with since I have typically excelled in an academic environment, but I’ll admit some disappointment that people don’t ask me for help more. I like to be thought of as an expert (even more so I like to feel like an expert, but I find that happens less as I grow older (more experienced? Wiser? One of the old greeks said something about the wisdom of knowing what you don’t know).

The aspect of the larger group that I find most overwhelming is trying to remember everyone, especially since many people seem to know who I am. But I enjoy learning about other people’s backgrounds and am amazed at what a great selection of people are attending the college. 

The experience of working so intensely in this type of team is entirely new. I have worked in teams before at school, university and work, but never with this amount of diversity in a team. And never sitting next to those team members everyday; with the majority of one’s efforts focussed on that team work. My immediate challenge with the first team was working with people who had skills and ways of operating very different from my own. I realised that for most of my career I have worked with the same people, all with the same background and training. This has made me less adaptable and less tolerant of different approaches to a problem. I am trying to learn to relax and give other people’s method of approaching problems a chance. 

I felt very comfortable being the group leader in the first sprint, and very uncomfortable giving up the reigns from the second sprint onwards. In the second project I usurped the actual leader on a number of occasions and seldom pulled myself back. 

I formed a real bond with my first team, despite (or because of) the struggles. In the second team our relationship seems more formal, although things went much more smoothly and the team was arguably more effective. 

I have found it very frustrating to deal with more reserved people. It is hard to read them and difficult for me to reserve judgement when they don’t produce tangible outputs. I am still trying to figure out how best to deal with these people, how to draw them out of their shell and how to have the patience to hear what they are trying to say. I also need to consciously tell myself that what they have to offer may be valuable (I remain unconvinced if the evidence is not right there on the table).

The experience has also underlined for me how much I rely on external encouragement and praise, this has played out it interactions with students and staff. I enjoy teaching other students, specifically one on one or in small groups, with alot of immediate feedback. In the first weeks I felt really supported by the facilitators, later weeks it felt like we had been abandoned for newer, more exciting projects. Similarly I felt much more secure with my first mentor’s hands-on, very available, approach than my second facilitator’s more reserved, hands-off approach."
I,N,T,J,"From a young age I have always been sheltered, reserved and terrified of getting out of my comfort zone. I knew this year would be a challenge as I’d be challenged to break out of my shell. The first day got real for me when I only knew one person out of a hundred. So i had to push myself and open up interact with a crowd (which I struggle with considering I’m very shy and standing in front of people makes me extremely nervous). Lucky for me the people here at the academy are very friendly and understanding.

Working in teams has never been a problem for me, the only issue has been being able to fully be the center of attention and speak my thoughts. But being here has taught me the importance to communicate my ideas without being shy. One of the biggest challenge with working in a team for me was dealing with teammates that aren’t fully committed to tasks that are assigned to them. I personally prefer to get things done in a certain way so it was a bit of a challenge when team timelines weren’t met and team members weren’t putting as much effort as everyone else. The lab exposes us to different personalities and one needs to learn how to work together effectively with this many personalities as many conflicting personalities could be a recipe for a disaster. I could say that I was lucky that in both the teams I had been assigned to weren’t too difficult. We all understood the importance of contribution and communication. Where there was a misunderstanding we’d address it before it becomes conflict, that way were able prevent it.

In all my teams the decision-making process has been pretty much the same. Generally, a challenge is put the team, we all communicate our strengths and weaknesses, from there we are able to distribute tasks together based on our strengths and weaknesses. When decisions need to be made, every member is given an opportunity to give his opinion and from the we decide together as a team taking into consideration every member's contribution.

Overall, the experience so far has been great. I am learning new things everyday. The workload does get challenging from time to time but it can be managed. I am slowly coming out of my shell, talking more, interacting more and opening up."
I,N,T,P,"My experience in the academy have really been a mixed bag so far. Initially I had to ""own"" whatever decision making process that was needed in order to get ahead  but now, with a new group, I've had to participate with others and have been made to feel more a ""follower"" than a leader at times. It's really nice working with people who have a myriad of personalities. I don't really think I've come across a situation that tempered with me emotionally although I do think of myself as quite the emotional person. I think so far our decision making have been just the way I prefer; logical and straightforward also with room for change as we improve our personal knowledge"
I,N,T,P,"I find my experiences at the academy to be interesting and fulfilling. I really like working with smart people and to EXPLORE gives me that in abundance. I have had a few personality clashes and character development hurdles that point to my need for growth and adjustment. One of my real challenges is to find a balance between zoning in to focus on my work and teaming up to discuss ideas with others or to help others.

If I had to choose to start over again I would have rather acted like a focused introvert because then I would give myself the time to learn without harming my learning curve. This honestly has contributed negatively to my group members who know, as well as I do, that I can deliver more.

Working together in the lab is the only thing that made real progress in the growth of us and as individuals. Crucial team decisions were easier to make. Working in the lab also has its downsides and I feel that I am still to take full advantage of this privilege.

I have missed a couple of key submissions already, I messed up two tests and failed badly. This made me aware that the team dynamics in the past have been negatively affected by the catch-up work that I had to do at the cost of the team process. I honestly think I am being too hard on myself but that also says that I have a high expectations of myself.

The decision-making process is usually one based on voting.  People who are seen as getting things or as knowledgeable automatically obtain more voting power. Past experience in the work is usually a drive in what a person chooses to do in the group and what role they are willing to play.

In the future, I would prefer, that rules of engagement be given thorough attention prior to the commencement of group work. In this way, the best can be obtained from everyone.

I personally believe that I need to be at a place where I am comfortable enough with the work to be done and the tools available. Once this has been accomplished. I can achieve more and contribute more."
I,N,T,J,"My experience in the academy thus far has been very potent and insightful to me this year, and it has changed my life to become a person who really enjoys the importance of cooperating with others. Being brought together with these amazing minds in this space has really helped me to acquire both soft and hard skills in a short space of time, and it has indeed helped to elevate my way of learning new technical subjects efficiently and effectively. Also, the management team at large especially the supervisors have been very instrumental and always improvising just to make sure that we are led in a way that will help us to walk away as well informed junior data scientists by the end of the year, hence they work tirelessly in making sure that they break down any obstacle to be so attractive and easily comprehended as possible for us in order to not being put off by the hard work. In addition to that, Nuri herself has a very formidable way of helping us to cope with our psychological illnesses caused by the intensity of the program, and she always go an extra mile in making sure that no one feels solitary. The supporting structure throughout the program is of importance, because it does help us to understand the essence behind excruciating our vulnerability to the management so to enable them to see what does work and not. In last words, I want to close by saying that being here for me means life, and I'm so grateful for the opportunity, and this is the very best thing that has ever happened in my life besides varsity, and I'm pretty sure that it will set my life for greater things and achievements."
I,N,T,J,"My time at the academy so far has been challenging, yet extremely rewarding and self-fulfilling - especially with regards to working with people from different backgrounds and domains of expertise. Although meeting different people has been interesting, I have been more concerned in how to bring different people together towards achieving a common goal.

In the two teams I have worked in, I have often been the one to take the lead, drawing from my ambition and past experience in relation to data science related fields. This has been challenging, since I am more used to - and more comfortable - working alone. I hold my personal contributions to team-based projects to the highest standards, and it is therefore difficult for me when other team members do not show the same dedication to team-based projects as I do.

Working in teams have challenged my personality in both positive and negative ways. I like being in control, and therefore it is difficult for me to allow other people to take the lead in different aspects of projects, especially if I objectively feel that I have more experience in completing the particular objective. However, I have learned that it is impossible to control 
 all aspects of a project and have therefore welcomed and aided contributions from other team members who have shown willingness and aptitude to contribute. In contrast, it has been difficult form me to motivate other team members who show apathy towards achieving a common goal. Although it has been somewhat frustrating, I have ensured that it has never derailed the team from following through with our initial plan and objectives. I have felt comfortable in the role of coordinator, and have relished the opportunity to deliver high-quality deliverables in high pressure situations.

My drive and work ethic has been very good, but I am not always the most productive worker. I have over-analysed and spent excessive amounts of time on subjects that have been interesting and challenging to me on a personal level, instead of focusing my time on the most pressing matters. I generally tend to spend most of my time on challenging and interesting concepts, and tend to postpone and often neglect routine and administrative tasks. This creates a frantic dash for the line when time runs out, and creates unnecessary anxiety. I am conscious of this shortcoming, and actively try to remind myself to prioritise and complete the most pressing matters regardless of personal interest.

I know I have often been regarded as serious by my fellow team mates, since I am always focused and driven when it comes to the task at hand. I have little time for chit-chat and tend to engage more in conversations related to intriguing and philosophical subjects. This is where I feel most comfortable and responsive. However, I have learned that more casual conversation regarding sports and hobbies helps me to learn more about team members, and forges professional, understanding relationships between team members. 

Overall, my work experience at the academy has been an enlightening one, but far from perfect.  have lots to learn, but am eager to improve in this aspect of my career to the benefit of both myself and team mates."
E,S,F,J,"The hardest moments of my life is learning new things, no matter how simple or easy that might be. That was the same difficulty I had when I met new people here in the Academy. The truth is I am talkative in nature, but I’ve always found it difficult to start conversations with students or anyone in the Academy. However, it has been an amazing experience to discover and learn more about different students’ cultural backgrounds and diversities, their interest in data science and life as whole. By my being at the Academy, I have realized that as people we learn and discover ourselves through our interaction with others.  
New environments can be nervous, but yet an exciting ones. The Explore Data Science Academy has been the best example of such scenarios. My being to this Academy has provided me with a great exposure to the working environment and the challenges that we ought to face when we work in teams. While being able to work in a team is the most prerequisite skill needed for a data scientist. This learning curve allowed me to be more self disciplined, self-motivated and to do introspection as no or little effort in group work affect the entire team’s progress and thus, it results with poor performance on the entire team work. Because we are people from different cultural, educational and programming backgrounds, learning the difference between what is right, who is right and when to be right became a key determining factor in understanding how to work with teams.  
After months of being in this Academy, I feel more close to becoming a data scientist than before. The hunger and efforts put in to understand data science seem to be rewarding now. It is a great feeling that I am among the first group to be given this opportunity to learn data science.  Although pressure is too much at times, but I hope and believe everything is designed and meant to prepare us to the real world working environments."
I,S,F,P,"Mixed emotions is what I went through when I came to Cape Town.I felt so ecstatic by the opportunity I was afforded  yet the other side of me was intimidated by the new environment. 
As I walked into the building on the first day my heart was filled with so much anticipation and I could wait to shake everybody's hand and introduce myself. There I was meeting with talented young and old bright sparks .

I never worked in a team before I came to the Academy , I did not know how it was working in a team and often many times I worked alone and did everything by myself. All that changed , when I was teamed up with bright minds and I actually got to work with them . I was really surprised by how much  effective and efficient  I was working in a team. I really enjoyed working in a team. 

I believe that travelling and meeting new people has a potential to widen ones horizons. I learnt a lot and I am still learning a lot from different people in the Academy, not only Academic related lesson but also life lesson that I will carry with me where ever I go.

I had a wonderful fruitful time with my previous team , though we had ups and downs .I learnt that we shouldn't leave issues in the group to grow rather we need to tackle them as they emerge."
I,N,F,J,"It was the 22nd of January 2018, the time was 7:00. That seemed like normal day and time. Then it hit me, the only difference was my location. I'm was in the Western Cape, Cape Town to be precise. I had moved away from home to embark on a journey to become a Data Scientist at the Explore Data Science Academy (EDSA).Today is the 8th of May 2018 and a lot has happened since then...

During the first week I got to meet other students from different family background and different level of education. I met the Explore Team, which included the supervisors, facilitators and Nuri. We were told we would be working in groups of fives. I was nervous because I got used to doing everything on my own. Actually I was terrified. 

The first group I was in was called Optimize Prime(still cracks me up). What made me nervous was that everyone but me had post matric qualification. At the beginning I thought that I was the underdog, until I realised that this was not a competition. I mean there must've been a reason for me to be teamed up with these guys, which was to learn and contribute wherever I can.

In the next group, we named ourselves Wolves of Woodstock (named after the movie Wolves of Wallstreet), I was more confident and more engaging. This was developed in the previous group. I even headed one of the sub projects. The experience was amazing was great. Even my sister didn't believe me.

In the first group were given the opportunity to work on the Cape Town water crisis, where we investigated the demand and supply factors that affected the Cape Town water crisis. In this project I got to use SQl and PowerBI for the first time. I saw another use of python that I didn't know it had the capability of doing, which was analysing data.

In the second group we got to explore the RSA stock market data. We used the data to predict the target return of individual companies. What was interesting about this project was not the accuracy of our predictions, but the limitations of our models.

In each group we were assigned supervisors. I got the chance to be mentored by two different supervisors. I wish I could create table of comparison, but the two were different, but effective.

There are times when the stats, python and all others gets too much. We had group sessions with Nuri, just to refresh."
I,S,F,J,"My experience at EDSA has been great so far.  It has been a massive learning curve academically but also personally.  I took the Myers-Briggs test twice: once, last night and then earlier today and got slightly different results.  The first time I came out with a letter combination of INFP and the second time ISFJ.  Though they are slightly different, I do feel that it is an accurate overall representation of the various attributes that I exhibit. 
 I am seen to be a Diplomat-Mediator as well as (second time taking the test) Defender Sentinel.  I am naturally reserved by nature, not unfriendly, but I prefer working alone and I am comfortable enough to sit alone in a group of people.  However, if approached, I come across as friendly. 
 I am able to read the various personality types in my groups fairly quickly, which allows me to quickly adapt to different situations and what is needed in the group at times.  I don't usually take charge, but If I know that there is an end goal and we have something to achieve, I prefer a clear cut plan on how to achieve it, which has been one of the challenging parts in working in a group, and has made me need to step out of my comfort zone recently to make decisions and voice myself.
The times that I experienced stress was due to the fact that I felt frustrated by myself not being able to comprehend certain concepts quick enough to do significant work for the project, other than that the deadlines itself was not much of an issue.
Overall, I feel that I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about myself in group dynamics so far at EDSA."
I,N,T,P,"I have had a very positive experience at the academy so far. I have enjoyed meeting other people who have a interest in data science and have also made this unusual choice of learning institution. It has been fascinating getting know the people in the class. People here have an incredibly wide range of personalities and backgrounds. I have generally enjoyed working in the lab though it can get rowdy after lunch as people's  work motivation decreases and motivation to socialise increases. While I found my first team members rather like-able, I felt our team dynamic failed dismally at properly tackling the project. We had some success in the beginning t but ultimately I was very disappointed with the team’s performance. We lacked cohesiveness and didn't project manage effectively. Some people focused exclusively on individual learning rather than group work. My second group was considerably better. We had a clear strategy and allocated tasks effectively. We had regular meetings, took minutes, and a wrote out tasks and sub deadlines. Each member was motivated and pulled their weight. We also communicated more frequently and we balanced individual and group tasks much better than my previous group. Decision making in my initial group was rational however we rarely executed those decisions as intended. There was a lot of procrastination and some members arrived late to class and left early. One group member spent most of her time away from the group chatting to friends. While she claimed she was working on group tasks, she ended up contributing absolutely nothing to any of the group tasks. In contrast, each individual in my second group went beyond the call of duty. We had regular meetings and ensured the tasks were divided properly. Progress was closely monitored and, when a problem occurred, we rallied together to solve it or adapt the strategy. There was one member of the group that was already quite experienced at the particular topic of the project and this was a tremendous advantage for us. We thought carefully about our team workflow and set up a the appropriate software and working folders. We analysed the project marking rubric and created a Gantt chart to schedule tasks, and understand dependencies. We also had to manage group member availability as each  member of the group required periods of absence  during the project. We also scheduled tasks around the class tests so we were aware of when time should be allocated to individual efforts. In my initial group there was an unhealthy diffusion of responsibility as each member assumed someone else would pick up the slack. This lead to some group members becoming despondent and refusing to carry the other group members. We also faced an issue where one group member didn’t feel he had sufficient programming skills to make a decent contribution to the group effort. Despite all these shortcomings our group got reasonable marks. The credit should only go to two out of the five group members. I am sure the second group will get good marks. Credit for this also cannot be given equally to all group members as one member was particularly strong. However I think the efforts were more equal than my previous group and everyone felt satisfied with the group effort in the end."

E,S,T,P,"i am a bit of a loner at times so id say the experience have really taught to me to engage with people and talk more especially because we as the student kind of have the same goal. The and based on the academic level i think o got more experience in programming for fact that i am now familiar with sql and python shows that have grown in the academic level.
 
Knowing that i had to wake up everyday to see new faces in the lab i thought that i will not be able to manage knowing that a loner and when i was told that we will be working in teams i thought that was the end of me because m not much of a talker than other people so i thought to myself how m i going to express my opinions, how will i participate but then it happened and i had best experience even started releasing that i need to talk in order for the opinion to be heard.

The last team had really understood me we did not have much of teams challenges and they valued my opinions and  and the decision making part was even pimplier, at first as team we agreed that everybody is gonna take part in everything and then we look at each other strength and weaknesses. 
From there  we assign one another with activities concerning the project but still not forgetting that we had to help each other strengthen our academy weaknesses so we basically created a Fridays for helping each other.

when it comes the decision of me coming the acadamy it was one of the hard decisions 
i had to take Cape Town being far from home and having to choose between completing my honors degree and academy. But i ended up choosing the academy over honors degree because i felt like i needed to experience data science in the marketing world and academy would be the best place to start and the fact that we were ought to learn everything from the beginning that was a great for me because my computing skills was not as i wanted them to be and stipend also contributed to that decision to me coming here.

i would to conclude that i do not regret coming here instead i am happy that i am here.its only being 5 months but already feel like the year is just going a bit faster than i want it to be even the programming skills i do not think i would have got this much experience in the programming languages skills if i was doing my honors.The experience i got so far is the best. It has not only helped me growing academically but also has helped me gain more confidence as an individual."
I,S,T,J,"I like meeting new people once in a while with similar interests as do I, but not too many new people all at once, so I have been connecting with people as time goes by and when we are assigned a new group. I haven't spoken to some students merely because they are strong introverts as myself, but the recent group nominated me the group coordinator and so I had to take a lead in every meeting, and in every interaction acknowledge how on a personal level are the group members feeling for that day, which is something I never really thought of or experienced before, it even grew where every Mondays we share what we did for the weekend, I really appreciated been put in that position to challenge myself to grow on a personal and not only academically. 

I like to make decisions based on the merits of the decision been and efficient and it has come to my attention that been efficient most of the time does not take into account people's feelings, so we made some decisions on my past group so that people will feel included and not left out, it is worth noting that before those same individuals did not contribute in the project in any way, and barely showed up to the academy, never written one single line of code and left me and the other member to take care of making the dashboard, presentation and ultimately present on our own, so the two of us took the uncomfortable route of diplomacy, we pleaded every morning with them to attend the briefings with the supervisor with us and all that, we went to group training sessions but all of that made no impact at all, but with the next group, they all understood what been at the academy meant and we worked together very well. They were stallions, magnificent, all of the sudden the paradigm had changed, I enjoyed having more than one idea to on how best to do things, I originally typed the minutes of the meetings but another member suggested trello which was more effective, I learnt something new, that excited me, because that day, well every day I went to bed knowing something I didn’t know when I woke up and that’s all a data scientist can ask for. 

Above all one important lesson I got from working with these two different groups is that if you leave time to guide how the team work will flow everyone will be miserable at the end of that project, but however if everything is over planned in trello (doesn’t have to be trello)  all the ‘tees’ crossed and the ‘eyes’ dotted, it can be a pleasant experience that will bring out the best out of everyone involved, you will team creativity grow to levels no one planned for in the beginning. And from now on, irrespective of whom I am put in a group to work with, we will sit down maybe second session after “getting to know each other” and map out our strategy with all roles assigned, significant and insignificant."

E,S,T,J,"EDSA Reflections

On 24 November 2017, I was filled with joy, excitement and anxious all at the same time when I opened an email from EDSA titled  “Congratulations! You’ve been accepted at the EXPLORE Data Science Academy!” 
Fast forward to 22 January 2018, I was ready to meet new people (possibly form new friendships), meet the EDSA team and learn more about what lies ahead for 2018, an overwelming day it was.

Today is 6 May 2018, a lot has happened over the past 3 months, I’ve learned so much! SQL, Stats, Python, Power BI, Presentation Skills…[still learning, it never stops :) ]. I am so grateful for being selected as one of the top 100, I’m very appreciative of this opportunity, thank you EDSA for making this possible for me. 

The Lab

Data Scientists in the making, I greatly enjoy being at the Lab, the environment is condusive to learning, a group of Data Science enthusiasts all in one room I feel is a receipe for success. Training is not only limited to Online Courses and EDSA Staff but as students we can learn a lot from each other , we all have different backrounds, skills and experience making the Lab a very interesting and fun place to grow both academically and socially.

Teamwork

The Water Crisis Project : Team LiquiData
I must say initially I was concerned with the amount of individual work we had and having to deliver for the team as well. This is where I realized the importance of an effective team, working well as a team reduced the work load stress and also very helpful with my individual tasks.
It was not all roses with regards to team dynamics, working with different individuals with their own perceptions and opinions was challenging at first, it was frustrating having to decide on certain matters, it helped a lot to be grounded on the Problem Statement as this kept us focused on what needed to be done. This worked well for me as I’m result driven and when given a task, completing that task successfully with all the required and relevant info is very important to me, so refering back to the Problem Statement when we got stuck was a great tool for us. We had some emotional moments in the team due to personality clashes but at the end we worked well and all contributed to the success of the team, Awesome Team!

The RSA Stock Market Project : Wolves of Woodstock
By now I had accepted that I’d have to work with new people, which really was not a problem for me, my only hope and wish was that we had a strong programmer in our team, and that wish was realised we had a statistician and programmer in my team, lovely! A great team, but I felt like the only outspoken person which was (is) a bit too much for me, we still worked well though and delivered.

I prefer working in a team because of different ideas, creativity and different skills and it’s a huge advantage when eveyone in the team is result driven, I absolutelty appreciate that. I’ve had good experience with my teams so far."
E,?,?,?,
I,N,T,P,"On my first day I first looked for familiar faces. After that I started looking for people that I would like to associate my self with. Meeting new people is fine as long as they didn't expect me to keep the conversation going. Found some nice, guys to hang out with.

I love working together in the labs, because then we could share idea's, findings and ways of doing certain things.

I enjoy working in teams. I believe 2 minds is better than one. There is also another line of validity checking. One also learns a lot of new things working in groups.

In team dynamics I like it when, everyone to knows what they need to be doing to achieve the bigger picture. Not in long term though because ones ideas will change as you have a clearer picture, having completed a task. (Problems change and unforeseen problems come up.)

Decisions where made on what has been done and then what still needs to happen. Some times I felt that some team members did not know exactly what it is they needed to do next (They just floated around).

Decision making was based off of what was possible without overworking everyone."
E,N,F,P,"I have enjoyed my time at EDSA so far. I love meeting new people and for the first time in my life i can talk with people face-to-face about programming and topics around data science. Previously it was just strangers over the internet. So it  is great discussing algorithms and coding challenges and geeking out with people that understand and contribute, rather watching people's eyes gloss over as you describe what you trying to achieve (in laymans terms).

I love that there is no prescribed uniform so everyone is as comfortable and naturally at ease, as opposed to a fashion parade. I have countless times struck up a conversation about work, the weekend or even the mountain. Sometimes team members get distracted abit too long or their guests talk abit too loud, but it hasn't been a big thing.

The biggest challenge has been balancing the studying and implementation of the theory when everyone is not on the same page. The team suffers when individuals are not pulling their weight which can put strain on the rest. Luckily I have found a few colleagues with whom i can kick around a few ideas or discuss solutions to current problems.

The decision making process has been by voting on the best way forward. typically consensus is reached about roles, but typically 2 or 3 members end up doing the bulk of the work. Conflict or resentment can  arise but so far no real flare ups have i encountered, it is hard for individuals to argue with the decision made if they are not present or have not put in any work. I tend to keep the peace and expect that everyone act as respectable adults. 

I hate micromanagement and love the freedom we are given with which to solve the problem statement. I am glad that we are able to view other teams' presentations and see how they went about solving the problem. I continue to learn a lot about data science as well as working in a time with a time constraint and seeing how people manage. Even with the workload there are others that offer their  time to assist those need help"
I,S,F,J,"This year was a huge one of change for me, involving many aspects: leaving my stable job, moving cities, moving into a new field, going back to being a student, having to do long distance and taking a chance on a brand new data science academy.

I was quite excited to meet all the new data science students despite my usual shyness. These were people who were taking similar plunges to my own and shared the an interest in the same field. I have enjoyed (slowly) meeting new people and learning about their backgrounds, and it has been very interesting how varied their stories are. 

Working in the lab has been a new experience. Complete self learning is a tough journey, so I am glad we have the Academy and the experience of the supervisors to help guide us on our way to becoming Data Scientists. It is a bit of an unusual area as it’s a computer lab for learning, but also sort of an office, but also where people socialise. I’m not sure it has nailed down what exactly it should be. I do feel I work better at home where it is quiet and comfortable(which is apparently in line with my personality profile too).

The group work element of this year is probably one of the biggest pain points. I can see the intent in setting us up this way, but I don’t think it has quite worked out yet . By itself group work is challenging. Throw in meeting new people with different backgrounds, a huge amount of new content to be learned and fairly significant stakes (internship opportunity) and you can have a difficult situation. I think this has resulted in frustrations running high and poor quality of the work delivered, below what any individual in the group would have wanted. I think just worrying about getting a project done has sometimes gotten in the way of actually trying to learn the content.

In terms of decision making with in groups so far, I think one positive is definitely that logic is valued in our field and by the students. If you can state the reasoning behind a plan solidly you wouldn’t have a problem. I think the challenge is that each group member can interpret instructions and priorities differently, sorting through this to get to get everyone on the same page can take valuable time. On a personal level I noticed that I am always looking for clear, decisive decisions and plans, and do not deal well with “just seeing how it goes”. I think this is something I need to look out for in not only a team setting, but in what I expect from a manager as well. 

Overall, I am still pretty excited for this year and have no regrets about my decision to join. I think the Academy is still a bit rough around the edges and needs refinement, but that is all part of the iterative process right?"
E,N,F,P,"My experience at EDSA has been one that has sparked a lot introspection. Socially, it made be affirm the fact that I am an extroverted person who cherishes human connection, communication and cares for other's well-being. With regards to team-work, it has made me realize that I can be quite assertive and that I prefer logical structure when it comes to completing tasks and fulfilling set roles. It made me also realize that I end up taking charge of the situation in the group, even when it wasn't what I had initially bargained for, mainly when it seems like there isn't much direction in the group and when time seems to be going to waste.

The decision- making process has been a rational one mostly but there have been times when it was based more on emotion because people would choose certain roles based on believing that they are good at a certain thing or because they have interest in it but at the end they don't end up achieving/delivering much or they end up burning out. 

I've also realized that when things don't go according to plan when it comes to activities that are part of my role, I stress and feel defeated easily but my perfectionist side creeps in and I end up completing what needs to be done on time. In future teams I wish to branch out and attempt to master every different skill to my best ability instead of focusing too much on my individual role, because I have a lot of potential and I know that I am capable."
