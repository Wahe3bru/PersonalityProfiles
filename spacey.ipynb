week gather sprint took team start making progress , thursday already figured system worked everyone order use something show supervisor. put weaknesses strengths table , started communicating better team. results shown supervisor told us think would deliver delivered , however , delivered end fundamental , faith would best one best. love good music , adventure socializing led connecting people group. time fundamentals spent helping people , building friendships would carry edsa year even greater , learning languages like python sql , channeling mind data scientist mode. weekends colleagues would tour cape town going beach , hike mountains could see edsa lab , visiting malls theme parks around cape town. python , one complex languages learn. well , thought since programming background. two teammates experience working languages , changing one language another , fairly doable. advantage since two people could consult whenever ran problem python. presentation fundamental one laid back fundamentals face since preplanned wanted add slides clear storyline. fact split fundamentals tore us apart , however , vowed exit whatsapp group created. review week , weekend , people never talked friends edsa lab suggested go theme park near canal walk mall take minds water crisis sprint. character part outting shy , yet interesting backgrounds. still friends them. stock market sprint came

people. since academy realised smarter think lot valuable knowledge insight share. biggest fear coming academy social aspect interact different people , since able overcome fear. first placed groups literally sweating , heart rate high felt sick stomach idea group strangers. second time split new groups ’ nervous. become social enjoy meeting working new people now. working groups challenge me. frustrating everyone different everyone different approach learning process project management. ’ learned lot working others. took backseat things even knew better way things. spoke saw helped team steer team better direction. become assertive. thought passive person ’ assertive save life , think assertive ’ find daunting. biggest frustration working teams dealing people think know everything ’ willing open learning something new fellow teammates. person like previous group. person would dictate team ’ want collaborate team , dominating personality rest us shy. realised none us ’ speak ’ fail sprint forced breakout shyness. think still fairly shy comes work fight shyness. decisions previous group initially made one person. prefer problems discussed everyone team different possible

deliver agreed planned. lab one best way work , especially comes group work , find collaborative useful. 's unfortunate group members choose work home leave early come late. found behavior hinder progress , especially tasks divided sub groups among group members. critical aspect group always communication. members usually communicate inability complete task late work due. members get emotional approach , end day always encourage one another see right side approach task project hand. working many different people taught rely others , means trust member work , even better me. fun leaning since day one .  enjoy meeting new people different walks life constant , everyday social interaction. slightly reserved comes approaching people much older me. also fear inadequate unqualified many people already worked professional environments qualification , undergraduate otherwise. large emphasis group work big learning curve always preferred work alone everything way want , although improved since time here. tend take charge unless one else better talking people helping find role. versatile n't mind taking least desired role despite preferences. one group decisive. general guideline try stick although hardly case. prefer versatile approach work. rather consistent method making decisions. little less organised group though. tend procrastinate make major decisions complete important tasks last minute. tend sway easily depending emotions. know let emotions run ahead ( since something known ) put foot , take step back examine things rational perspective. hard easy put emotions beside .  life academy. wonderful experience , joyous full many possibilities. 22nd january 2018 took tax kraainfontein heading woodstock , place never , told far capetown cbd. exact location going woodstock exchange building 's explore data science academy located. help asking people taxi help gps able find building got around 10:30 , yes late got presentation room aidan ( supervisor ) giving overview academy expected us ( student ) . room full 100 students different provinces , races backgrounds. listened long bearded white guy speaking eloquent profound right. one thing struck intention emphasis speech intelligent ( students ) apparently 8000 people applied

students ) split group five people work capetown water crisis using skill learnt past week i.e sql , python power bi. group name bean bags , group four males one female , embark project , use divide conquer approach help assign work member , group members wonderful people work , jelled much fun together . bean bags often worked together , using one computer helped tasks assigned member. worked together two months present findings regarding capetown water crisis solutions suggestions sprint came end. split south african stock market project , working different people adjust new team went name stockoverflow , bit nervous previous team already made friends working together forged friendship amongst adjust. stockoverflow team three males two females , sprint month much done. learning different models predict stock prices fascinating challenging me. used divide conquer approach assigning tasks member consolidating member done google drive , 26th april presented model predictions stock price one week break came back another sprint. realized short space time learned many many skills apply solve real world problems. wonderful experience grateful .  big part joining academy year meeting working lots new people. unexpectedly positive experience. despite everyone different backgrounds , sense camaraderie interns friendly. even though everyone tested graded environment non-competitive people willing help other. made enjoyable work lab. however , noise bustle lab sometimes overwhelming draining find productive sometimes spend hour two day lab working home quiet. challenging aspect year far teamwork. first project ( cape town water crisis ) times conflict team due team member contributing much therefore shifting workload team members. led resentment team members , expected. team projects work rarely equally divided team managed complete project despite difficulties. reflecting experience grateful done big share work gave opportunity learn lot would otherwise. second project ( jse stock market sprint ) much shorter time span therefore team approached project different. team divide work time everyone involved deliverables. hard meant trusting people work without directly involved dependant complete it. process decision making teams democratic. team discusses problems possible approaches usually obvious decision everyone agrees on. decision making far tended rational team members emotional. emotional part projects stress faced final deadlines neared. , experience academy far positive learnt lot. hope improve way approach team work upcoming sprints .  choosing spend year explore data science academy could easily best choice ever made. choice renewed feeling purpose educational/occupational direction. learnt past 3 months thought would entire year grateful presented opportunity. fellow students edsa staff added excellent experience encountered thus far. interacting brilliant minds results one , inevitably , attempting better experienced first hand. excited path edsa setting look forward future holds prospective data scientist : )  hardest moments life learning new things , matter simple easy might be. difficulty met new people academy. truth talkative nature , ’ always found difficult start conversations students anyone academy. however , amazing experience discover learn different students ’ cultural backgrounds diversities , interest data science life whole. academy , realized people learn discover interaction others. new environments nervous , yet exciting ones. explore data science academy best example

self-motivated introspection little effort group work affect entire team ’ progress thus , results poor performance entire team work. people different cultural , educational programming backgrounds , learning difference right , right right became key determining factor understanding work teams. months academy , feel close becoming data scientist before. hunger efforts put understand data science seem rewarding now. great feeling among first group given opportunity learn data science. although pressure much times , hope believe everything designed meant prepare us real world working environments .  mixed emotions went came cape town.i felt ecstatic opportunity afforded yet side intimidated new environment. walked building first day heart filled much anticipation could wait shake

achieve , one challenging parts working group , made need step comfort zone recently make decisions voice myself. times experienced stress due fact felt frustrated able comprehend certain concepts quick enough significant work project , deadlines much issue. overall , feel thoroughly enjoyed learning group dynamics far edsa .  nan  nan  enjoyed time edsa far. love meeting new people first time life talk people face-to-face programming topics around data science. previously strangers internet. great discussing algorithms coding challenges geeking people understand contribute , rather watching people 's eyes gloss describe trying achieve ( laymans terms ) . love prescribed uniform everyone comfortable naturally ease , opposed fashion parade. countless times struck conversation work , weekend even mountain. sometimes team members get distracted abit long guests talk abit loud , n't big thing. biggest challenge balancing studying implementation theory everyone page. team suffers individuals pulling weight put strain rest. luckily found colleagues kick around ideas discuss solutions current problems. decision making process voting best way forward. typically consensus reached roles , typically 2 3 members end bulk work. conflict resentment arise far real flare ups encountered , hard individuals argue decision made present put work. tend keep peace expect everyone act respectable adults. hate micromanagement love freedom given solve problem statement. glad able view teams ' presentations see went solving problem. continue learn lot data science well working time
