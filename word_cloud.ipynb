working found difficult get back line doing. decision teams need made , seemed myth. team needed carry lot workload rest team members order get scores wanted , trying teach team thing two long way. similar situation second sprint , severe , 2 members team got flying start , 2 spectating participating one eventually found feet ended bang , last member , felt , never contributed final ``

awesome experience happy chose .  intimidating meeting many new people , especially wildly different personalities backgrounds. sharing work space sometimes challenging everyone shares views communal space treated terms cleanliness keeping noise levels down. interacted lot people , small number individuals like background temperament. team dynamics far challenging part course. particularly struggle team-members lack self-motivation work ethic. found often instead insisting team member pulling weight would rather task myself. tend feel someone lacks motivation something unlikely perform task best abilities. also seem little confidence others completing task way would like done. generally , decision making teams easy mostly due apathy uncertainty surrounding decision behalf team members. found frustrating since often lead one-sided discussion resulted unspoken dissatisfaction resultant product. decisions also often ignored later , dont mind changing decisions believe communicated completing project still paramount. feel often good sense required complete project communicate steps team members , however rarely self-assurance properly delegate tasks hold people accountable meet deadlines complete task .  experience far great though first bit anxious excited whole program , working teams challenging first still becoming less less challenging , far groups far completely different 's interesting terms knowing works n't , also helps experiencing different thinking processes ...  experiences edsa experience academy intense , interesting fun. even though met small subset people academy , great gotten know time. also particularly interesting , seeing different everyone ’ background perspective is. learning come want life chose apart academy. working lab great experience , reminds worked open plan office space feel like ’ great comfortable environment work in. also proven difficult times , slow computers noisy environment keeping focused sometimes tricky , views mountain really great ’ complain much. regards team dynamics , two groups part different terms worked , however overlap dynamics. one dynamic found two groups extroverted individuals groups took leadership role early team took cues two groups pushed leadership role. part groups introverted individuals extroverted ones. ’ major conflicts clashes dominance. first group differences personalities caused friction conflict. despite , got long worked together cohesively meet goals. natural personalities would create conflict never lost sight there. regards decision making two groups. first group lot uncertainty terms approach problems created environment aimlessness uncertainty times. second group came consensus based strengths team members would allocate roles accordingly. decisions first group made based high emotions think caused new environment learning new skills created stress , coupled trying meet deliverables made tensions high. whereas second group came decisions based logical approach. would say overall decision making rational tried deal problem statements thoughtful planned manner would allow us cope coordinate responsibilities effectively .  data science academy amazing path far , one room people ambitious love learning got excited work also supervisors facilitators determined love job motivates even keeps thrilled like one day. thankful part academy , much learn everyday proven need specific field certain level education data scientist , way academy structured students fields various level education think great idea , would see someone never studied computer science statistics knowing concept better degrees , brief say need order survive academy focused know expected everyday. fortunate enough placed teams people determined never struggled get group mate deliver expected , hence said people academy focused know for. think selection team good job placing us academy. appreciate also fact much supervisors facilitators busy , always accessible help us work passion , see getting better better day become data scientist certain end year level corporate expects be. academy coaching sessions assists come across obstacles program , work related personal problems , someone talk share predicaments going , find helpful workload much might loose track things , especially something distracting going personal life , deviate attention work , think service useful personally used load shoulders shared problems someone trust judge share problems anyone. randomly placed teams believe help us come across different personalities people learn work around , although people hoped , believe prepares us fit enough deal people meet corporate world. also learn assist patient people might struggle certain concept also learn others .  good day , really n't know start essay besides good day. anyway 's way lets start business. moments academy mostly up. let start day one meeting students south africa great , meeting people different personalities coming different background. people different races , culture tribes ( enjoy stuck cape town since day born. ) . getting first team , part crazy , fun team. guys n't look one another open , strength. first weeks everyone working well getting close end became frustrated team members started lose focus ( assume got tired sprint long ) . following team great came work bonding n't all. two members liked working home ( productive ) two quit time. came decision making , meter bouncing ideas around choosing one move stayed one teams. second team split two teams two teams thing 's believe new way things great. submitting individual team one learnt skill taught sprint. thanks .  imagine excited finally meet people like minded. maybe could rephrased meeting people like me. however , instead , meet small sample different types people different types personalities. yet find stuck world different types people different , different interest ambitions , translates make decisions every day. decisions affect , especially working teams. hand , decisions make affect team processes. according personality test , personality defined five letters entp-t ,

effectively lab challenge , many distractions. found easier get know people type strengths , knowledge background passions general. type knowledge allows efficient knowing ask help different things. prefer asking facilitator. always done past prefer working challenge peer , along process learn would otherwise. comes working teams , always , first one speak give opinion came variety ideas , ’ extroverted side me. therefore , end leading , team. role prefer police people , therefore either allowed people lead would make sure project requirements completed end. last sprint dedicate

fully understand analysis analysis team performed. decision-making group rational. working labs , nerve-wracking experience significant proportion people simply go socialise distracting us , prefer working environment absolute silence ( hence prefer working midnight ) simply think problem allow creative possible solving problem. people assist thought-processes terms thinking problem solutions irritating distraction. around many people long eventually lose focus problem focus people , would much better silence mandated enforced labs. also need individual work instead group-work. suggests ways could contribute group signs learnt lessons emerged previous group , still lot trepidation comes next. hope meet group members committed project , otherwise , everything end tears .  enjoy meeting new people different walks life constant , everyday social interaction. slightly reserved comes approaching people much older me. also fear inadequate unqualified many people already worked professional environments qualification , undergraduate otherwise. large emphasis group work big learning curve always preferred work alone everything way want , although improved since time here. tend take charge unless one else better talking people helping find role. versatile n't mind taking least desired role despite preferences. one group decisive. general guideline try stick although hardly case. prefer versatile approach work. rather consistent method making decisions. little less organised group though. tend procrastinate make major decisions complete important tasks last minute. tend sway easily depending emotions. know let emotions run ahead ( since something known ) put foot , take step back examine things rational perspective. hard easy put emotions beside .  honesty enjoying time regret choices made. really educational love structure , environment one force work push much facilitator really helpful bounce ideas see far able explore imagination. meeting new people 's always nice stories people far go life , combine different cultural group things got learn people 's culture stories tell. work together 's really tricky fun times tricky , matter many times think always tricky talk wont enough words left. making decisions 's simple everyone agreeing goals deadline arrived people stories , 'm unable relate excuses , honestly wish everyone could adhere words , really would like decisions made like explore lot 'm working something due time constrain sometimes 's best expected enough time explore more. team members sensitive way sensitive leave part there. love academy wish time learn bit , enough resources even conduct maybe research , instance know write good machine learning algorithms n't understand work might even able improve .  life
