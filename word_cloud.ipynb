'm western cape , cape town precise. moved away home embark journey become data scientist explore data science academy ( edsa ) .today 8th may 2018 lot happened since ... first week got meet students different family background different level education. met explore team , included supervisors , facilitators nuri. told would working groups fives. nervous got used everything own. actually terrified. first group called optimize prime ( still cracks ) . made nervous everyone post matric qualification. beginning thought underdog , realised competition. mean must 've reason teamed guys ,

great. even sister n't believe me. first group given opportunity work cape town water crisis , investigated demand supply factors affected cape town water crisis. project got use sql powerbi first time. saw another use python n't know capability , analysing data. second group got explore rsa stock market data. used data predict target return individual companies. interesting project accuracy

quick enough significant work project , deadlines much issue. overall , feel thoroughly enjoyed learning group dynamics far edsa .  nan  nan  enjoyed time edsa far. love meeting new people first time life talk people face-to-face programming topics around data science. previously strangers internet. great discussing algorithms coding challenges geeking people understand contribute , rather watching people 's eyes gloss describe trying achieve ( laymans terms ) . love prescribed uniform everyone comfortable naturally ease , opposed fashion parade. countless times struck conversation work , weekend even mountain. sometimes team members get distracted abit long guests talk abit loud , n't big thing. biggest challenge balancing studying implementation theory everyone page. team suffers individuals pulling weight put strain rest. luckily found colleagues kick around ideas discuss solutions current problems. decision making process voting best way forward. typically consensus reached roles , typically 2 3 members end bulk work. conflict resentment arise far real flare ups encountered , hard individuals argue decision made present put work. tend keep peace expect everyone act respectable adults. hate micromanagement love freedom given solve problem statement. glad able view teams ' presentations see went solving problem. continue learn lot data science well working time time constraint seeing people manage. even workload others offer time assist need help  year huge one change , involving many aspects : leaving stable job , moving cities , moving new field , going back student , long distance taking chance brand new data science academy. quite excited meet new data science students despite usual shyness. people taking similar plunges shared interest field. enjoyed ( slowly ) meeting new people learning backgrounds , interesting varied stories are. working lab new experience. complete self learning tough journey , glad academy experience supervisors help guide us way becoming data scientists. bit unusual area ’ computer lab learning , also sort office , also people socialise. ’ sure nailed exactly be. feel work better home quiet comfortable ( apparently line personality profile ) . group work element year probably one biggest pain points. see intent setting us way , ’ think quite worked yet . group work challenging. throw meeting new people different backgrounds , huge amount new content learned fairly significant stakes ( internship opportunity ) difficult situation. think resulted frustrations running high poor quality work delivered , individual group would wanted. think worrying getting project done sometimes gotten way actually trying learn content. terms decision making groups far , think one positive definitely

far home choose completing honors degree academy. ended choosing academy honors degree felt like needed experience data science marketing world academy would best place start fact ought learn everything beginning great computing skills wanted stipend also contributed decision coming here. would conclude regret coming instead happy here.its 5 months already feel like year going bit faster want even programming skills think would got much experience programming languages skills honors.the experience got far best. helped growing academically also helped gain confidence individual .  first day first looked familiar faces. started looking people would like associate self with. meeting new people fine long n't expect keep conversation going. found nice , guys hang with. love working
